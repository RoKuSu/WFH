The question to ask these three cold heart credit report institutions is that if they feel {$37.00} is a serious delinquency? 
And worst of all is that these cold heart institutions will keep reporting for seven years this {$37.00} as a serious delinquency even though is has been paid off. 
I believe, a law should be passed to ban these credit report institutions from reporting as serious or even plain delinquencies amounts below {$100.00} or a sum considered irrelevant. I will write today a letter to my district congresswoman to start a campaign against these and other harmful policies and practices and have the US Congress review these credit report institutions to obligated them to have fair and reasonable practices and policies.

Nobody is a delinquent for having a {$37.00} record or {$100.00} or {$1000.00} on their report, is not a crime, a delinquent is a person that has transgressed the law, its illegal to call somebody a delinquent for an unpaid bill. This is unacceptable. 
These institutions have to do their home work to establish once received a report specially from collection agencies if the report is fraudulent or not, it seems these institutions only collect information and sell it as is, they have not adopted controls over the information received or at least, get in contact with the affected consumer to check if its a fraudulent record.

I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

I'm filing a complaint here, however if I don't hear back from the bank or Amazon, I will file a lawsuit against the bank for malpractice and overcharging my account. I will not let this go and I'm not agreeing on paying for this ridiculous high interest fee. This is outrageous and unbelievable. Banks can just charge you fees and interest like that without giving you a warning. Who is going to protect us.

After you intervened, Wells Fargo ( WF ) did finally pay me on XX/XX/XXXX the then-remaining credit balance of {$4200.00} on my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I then paid WF {$400.00} to cover a {$400.00} charge I'd made to cover a dental bill I had put on the card on XX/XX/XXXX. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, WF put a FALSE AND FRAUDULENT debit charge on the card of {$4600.00}, which I had NOT incurred and which they labelled a "" payment adjustment '', so that the card appeared to have a "" balance '' ( owing ) of {$4200.00} even though there actually was no balance owing at all. Since then, I have phoned them repeatedly, spoken to multiple Reps and multiple Supervisors on recorded lines. Each and every one of the people I spoke to, on reviewing the account, agreed that I owe WF no money, they owe me no money, and my account balance is XXXX. They have at least twice escalated the issue to Corporate, to the effect that I received a letter from Corporate dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they received my WF complaint # XXXX and I would hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX, and then a follow-up letter ( same case ) dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I "" can expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX ''. Meanwhile, sometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I got a phone call ( male, don't recall name ) who reassured me that WF agreed I have a XXXX balance, and they were working on it, and in the meanwhile until they fixed their records they would not require any minimum payment on this "" phantom '' {$4200.00} because they knew I didn't owe them any money, nor would I have to pay any Interest or any "" didn't make payment '' fees. Then last week on XX/XX/XXXX I logged on to my account, and not only was the {$4200.00} still there, but now it also demanded that I pay a {$42.00} minimum payment. When I then called again ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) the Rep "" XXXX XXXX '' said that [ 1 ] she had seen this exact kind of problem before and would send another Complaint to Corporate, and [ 2 ] if I didn't pay at least {$42.00} on this money I DID NOT OWE then WF would charge me a nonpayment fee, and [ 3 ] if I didn't pay WF the ENTIRE {$4200.00} that I didn't owe then they would charge me Interest on any "" unpaid '' amount. I then spoke to her Supervisor XXXX who told me that though she agreed ( looking at the record ) that I didn't owe WF any money and the {$4200.00} "" balance owing '' they had on my account was in ERROR, she couldn't do anything about it ; XXXX said SHE would also send another Complaint to Corporate, and XXXX told me that she could request for me a temporary "" COVID19 '' waiver of both minimum payments AND any interest charges on any unpaid balance, so that's what I did. I have spent at least 5 hours and probably more like 10 hrs or more both being on Hold and talking to many WF Reps about this {$4200.00} that my Statement has on it but that WF agrees I do not owe, and have gotten NOWHERE.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

90,"Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

I never recieved anything at my address and nor did i sign for anything and believe it is fraud. The seller never responded. 
The seller never responded to numerous emails that I sent via XXXX. It was then i contacted ATTUniversal card. The person who took my call must have misunderstood me and opened a case of fraudulent charge that i did not authorize. But I did authorize the charge but I never recieved the item. 
I even called the next day and spoke to another agent at ATTuniversal and they said that I did a good thing of calling as the case only showed that a fraudulent charge was made. 
The agent stated that he was able to add notes to the current case and that things should resolve soon. Sadly, that is not what happened. I was never contacted about anything in regards to the situation by ATTuniversl citi cards. I simply got a Letter via online that stated against me but was a little confusing. So i called ATTuniversal again and they said nothing to worry, they have agreed in my favor. i was relieved to hear that. But later, i saw the charge was added to my billing in the amount of XXXX . Clearly there has been a mistake. I have already contacted ATTuniversal Citi and also XXXX. They have stated that the case is ongoing but what I do not see that anywhere on my acct on ATTuniversal citi nor XXXX but i was told the case is open and the merchant has been contacted. I must have made about 30 calls to XXXX and attuniversal citi cards regarding this matter. They should have a record of all calls and also recordings.

The XXXX listing is XX/XX/XXXX but delivery shows XX/XX/XXXX? to XXXX XXXX, XXXX .... I am in XXXX. not in XXXX. Once again, item bought XX/XX/XXXX but delivered XX/XX/XXXX? how can that be? and delivered to XXXX  where the item was supposedly coming from. I am in XXXX  my whole life.

I even mailed it to the Citi cards via certified mail and also to XXXX but to no avail did I get a response.

Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

104,"I first notified XXXX XXXX back in XXXX of an account that is reporting on my credit report that is not mines. This is account was fraudulent obtained by a relative of mine who has a similar name as mine. I was told from XXXX XXXX attorney to have a copy of a letter notarized from the relative stating that this was not my account and that I was not responsible for the bill. Once I did that I was told by the attorney to send a copy of the notarized letter to XXXX XXXX and they would delete it off of my credit report. I did that as well and it was never deleted off of my Credit Report. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to call and harass me regarding this account. They called in XXXX and again in XXXX demanding that I pay this. In XXXX I was told from a representative that they would be deleting it from my credit report and that I would not be getting anymore calls. Upon me trying to obtain a house in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that this was still showing up on my Credit Report. I contacted XXXX XXXX by phone in XXXX disputing this account once again. I was told that I owe the money and that I needed to pay it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I then sent in a letter to all 3 Credit Bureaus ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX  ) disputing the accuracy of an account reporting on my credit report that was not mine.I was also disputing the several inaccurate addresses on my report that belongs to the relative who obtain the Credit. I also asked the Credit Bureaus to send me documentation that I signed for this loan as well as the name of the person who they contacted from the Original Lender. On XX/XX/XXXX I received dispute results back from all 3 Credit Bureaus stating that the account was verified as accurate along with the different addresses. I never received any other supporting documentation with it. According to the FCRA if the Credit Bureaus nor the Original Data Furnisher can provide me with supporting information within 30 days of the dispute they must delete the inaccurate information from my credit report. 

How is it possible for all the Credit Bureaus to get accurate information from XXXX XXXX when I truly have proof that this information is inaccurate along with the addresses. That leads me to believe that the Credit Bureaus did not do a thorough investigation nor did XXXX XXXX send them accurate information. I have a notarized letter from the person who got the loan in my name. The notarized letter specifically has his Social Security Number on there along with his full name. On the letter you will see that we have the same first and last name. Same middle initial. However, it is a different Middle name although it is the same INITIAL.

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is nota factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is that they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

It is the second time in six months that BA has failed to provide access to my funds. In the first instance, BA admitted that it failed to provide immediate access to funds transferred to my account from the Federal Treasury.

This time, BA is not providing access to funds deposited directly with them. 
The date of the most recent occurrence was XX/XX/2020 : The initial time was XXXX XXXX ( I had an appointment ). 

For the last six months, I've had two CDs at BA -- one of six months duration and a renewable nine month CD. 

Subsequent to the maturity date of the two CDs, I went to the local branch to renew the nine month CD ( {$130000.00} ), intending to include in the new nine month CD {$15000.00} in cash from another account at the bank, and the balance in the six month CD ( {$32000.00} ).

The first person who tried to complete the task failed to include the {$15000.00}. Efforts on the part of a more senior employee with help from the back of the BA 's CD Department resulted ( I've been told ) to the addition of the {$15000.00} to the CD account.

I was informed that it could take as long as a week to correct the Bank 's system, and until that time I would not have access to MY {$15000.00}. 

Really? It was already my money, and it's in the bank. 

Though the performance of the two individuals in the branch was less than stellar. My complaint is that BA 's system doe not provide a way for human employees to correct mistakes made by the bank in a way that provides depositors with immediate access to their funds.

Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

234,"Citibank refuses to remove me as an authorized user on my mother 's credit card. Both my mother and I have spent over 7 hours on the phone with Citi Bank on XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 respectively. We were transferred around endlessly between different departments, each saying they do not have the authority to process the request because my mother is on a repayment program, and I must talk to the department who last transferred us. It doesn't appear anyone at the company is capable of performing this routine function. 

Even though the account was closed nearly 3 years ago, they only started reporting my authorized user status to credit reporting agencies one month ago, which caused my credit score to drop 20 points in 30 days, so it is not a trivial matter. 

My belief is that Citibank wants to keep me as an authorized user and apply credit pressure in case my elderly mother dies or defaults on payments so that they can come after me, despite there being no legal justification for keeping me on the account that they can cite. Not only is the account closed, I haven't even had a physical card for this account or initiated a purchase on it in nearly 10 years.

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

Early XX/XX/2020, I applied for a VA refinancing loan from Union Bank. At the onset of the application I was advised not to include the income that I received for hosting an exchange student at my home. 

My VA refinance application ( Union Bank Loan Number XXXX ) has been pending over 90 days without resolution. I have paid my own appraisal fee and pest inspection fee prior to the latest closing disclosure dated XX/XX/2020. 
My cash out has been reduced from {$80000.00} to {$19000.00} with the same monthly payment. Most of the XXXX Veterans ( like myself ) own one home and has lived in XXXX County for a long time ( 39 years ) and subsist on their VA XXXX as their primary income. I ( enjoy ) hosting international students as supplementary income for the unexpected expenses and I have been hosting for 10 years. 

I applied for my loan before the pandemic and I am grateful that financial institutions are in place, making loans and providing general banking needs, however, I do not want people losing their homes to fancy math. I have lived through the US predatory loans era and the market recession of XXXX. 

Every eligible veteran applying for a VA loan should be entitled to the lowest interest rate loans on the market. Ive owned my home for 15 years, never late on my mortgage-yet the loan process has taken more than 90 days to get the loan to the disclosure stage. 

I am praying for the ( VA ) loan process to be streamlined and fairly dispersed, so that individuals like myself can prepare for our families within this pandemic. 


Sincerely XXXX XXXX My questions Is it true, that as the interest rate has been lowered, Union Bank charges a higher interest rate for refinancing VA loans? 
Ive paid for my VA appraisal {$600.00}, pest inspection {$150.00} and re-inspection {$99.00} as I have filed this complaint can they cancel my loan? What protections from retaliation does a borrower have?

From XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, there were approximately XXXX transactions on the card totaling {$33000.00} by my calculations. Citi bank never informed me of these fraudulent charges despite how many there were. It was only after I checked my balance online did I see the charges and notify them. I also immediately notified XXXX. 

I was asked to be patient by Citi and was told it could take two or three billing cycles to resolve the issue. I have not received any communications from Citi or XXXX to keep me informed as to the progress. All that I've been told from Citi was that the investigation is closed and resolved via email. It does appear that there are credits on the account of {$38000.00}. I have no idea why that amount does not coincide with the {$33000.00} in fraudulent charges.

These are duplicate charges that now appear as a balance.

309,"Due to Covid-19 I wanted to explore my repayment options on the mortgage. My loan is serviced by SunTrust, which is now Truist. 

I first spoke with a representative from Suntrust by the name of XXXX XXXX. He explained that no deferment was available, and by direction from XXXX XXXX ( The owner of the loan ) they have only been advised to offer a Forbearance. I did not see the benefits of the forbearance program, except for as a fail safe. XXXX explained that I could enroll into the forbearance program and keep my bi-weekly recurring auto ebit schedule. SunTrust would continue to debit me automatically on my same schedule, but if I could not make a payment at any time, I would "" fall back '' onto the forbearance. The ability to keep my biweekly recurring auto payment was the ONLY reason I agreed to the program. SunTrust makes you jump through hoops to enroll into bi-weekly debits, which ultimately save a customer money in interest the long run. You have fill out a form, wait a month, and pay your mortgage up a month. Before my refinance my loan was serviced through XXXX XXXX, and I could set up bi-weekly debits within minutes on their website. I think SunTrusts practices on setting up bi-weekly debits is borderline unfair and deceptive. It should be simple for a consumer to set up their mortgage in a way that's beneficial for them to save money on interest. 

Seven to 10 days later, I also spoke with a representative from Home Preservation - the department that handles the Forbearance process for SunTrust. She also advised me that I did not have to stop my bi-weekly recurring auto debit. She also went a step further and said that if I did, I would have to go through the process of re-enrolling, which I just explained is not consumer friendly. I confirmed with her multiple times that I did not want to do this. My home preservation specialist name is XXXX XXXX. The representative stated that I could enroll into Forbearance and keep my auto payments, just like XXXX did above. 

My bi-weekly payment was scheduled to debit on XX/XX/XXXX and it did not come out. Later the next week I received a letter from SunTrust stating that I was enrolled into the Forbearance program, and my recurring auto debit had ceased. I spent the entire week of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX unsuccessfully trying to get hold of XXXX XXXX or anyone at SunTrust and Home Preservation - including waiting on hold 2+ hours several times and sending multiple emails. SunTrust 's IVR phone system states that I could leave a call back number and receive a call back within 24 hours, which I have not received. 

When I finally got through to someone on XX/XX/XXXX, I was advised that I was misinformed. I requested my situation to be escalated for a solution. I want things to go back to normal, even if I have to withdraw from forbearance. Enrolling into forbearance was me being proactive, and looking at the worst case scenario due to the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19. All the while I have the funds to pay, and want to pay on my bi weekly auto recurring schedule. 

Interesting to note that the entire enrollment into the Forbearance program is done verbally. There is no e-sig or signature required to sign that clearly outlines the program and contract. If there was, and it was delineated that auto-payments would stop, I would not have enrolled. 

I spoke to two representatives who advised me supervisors were unavailable. Neither person was able to clearly articulate a path back to normalcy and guarantee no adverse effects on my account or credit. Also, they stated I would have to go through the SunTrust run around to re-enroll into bi-weekly auto recurring debits, which again is a hassle. Matter of fact, it took me several months to enroll into this program the first time after my refinance from XXXX XXXX, simply because you have to jump through so many hoops!

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX   XXXX/XXXX  I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these  accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

Suntrust has : 1 ) hidden all guidance about mortgage forbearance on its website so that it is impossible to navigate to within its website ( I had to find it through an external search engine ) ; 2 ) failed to post on its website ANY accurate information about borrower rights under the CARES Act ; 3 ) required mortgage customers to speak to a phone representative to request forbearance, and 4 )  understaffed or non-staffed its mortgage customer service phone line so that it is impossible to speak to a representative to request forbearance. 

Yesterday, XX/XX/2020, I waited on hold on Suntrusts customer service line for two hours and 28 minutes, at which time the line simply went dead. No one answered, and I did not hang up Suntrusts system just ended the call. After two hours and 28 minutes on hold. 

Feeling desperate, I tried the line again tonight, XX/XX/2020, when Suntrust *says* it staffs the line until XXXX XXXX. It is now XXXX XXXX and I have been waiting tonight for one hour and 15 minutes, with no end in sight. 

So here is my question : who is checking to make sure that Suntrust is making reasonable efforts, or indeed any efforts, to enable borrowers to request forbearance on their mortgages?

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts. 

COLLECTION AGENCY : No Name on Report ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX In addition, it has also been discovered that these XXXX LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these XXXX  Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education  or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

414,"At the beginning of this year we decided to refinance our home. A combination of our credit scores and income documentation, lead to us finding Recovco Mortgage Management , LLC dba XXXX XXXX. Having been a mortgage banker for over 8 years, I did my due diligence with these folks upfront. We sent them over 150 pages of banking statements to be reviewed in detail and ensure that we were qualified financially before starting the loan process. 

It took us 8 weeks to navigate the loan qualification process and then another 2 weeks for the closing. The end result is a deed of trust was recorded on our home and we were never given a loan. We reached out to them and the XXXX XXXX the day after the deed was recorded, only to learn that they had no intention of funding it and had begun the process of attempting to rescind the deed of trust. XXXX  made the decision to halt funding and attempt to rescind my loan without letting us know. The collusion between the two companies is self-evident and is the reason neither made any effort to update us on Monday or Tuesday morning. There was a conscious decision made to withhold that information and an attempt to rescind the documentation without communicating any of it to us. 

After a week of silence, we received an email from XXXX telling us that they sent XXXX XXXX a "" satisfaction '' for the deed of trust. There has been no satisfaction to this loan, because there was never a loan itself. There was a misfiled deed of trust that remained on our home for over a week. There was no communication from XXXX during that timeframe and we still never received anything in writing as to what happened. We qualified and closed on a loan, that they chose to back out of at the 13th hour and then colluded with XXXX XXXX, their normal title company, to rescind the deed of trust without telling us. Not only did we supply this company with our 100 's of pages of personal documents, we also paid for an appraisal that meant nothing because they couldn't off a product to justify it with. The result of this, is that in our current climate we are left in financial ruin, with no answers and two corporations that walked all over us. Both companies treated us poorly throughout the process and especially when it was time to fulfill their side of the qualified transaction. 

The NC Bar Association has reviewed this information along with a 16 page timeline of the events and full communication that occurred. They have decided to launch an investigation that is ongoing at this time. Both a litigation and real estate attorney have also reviewed the information and stated that there is a valid claim. It was noted that there was a breach in XXXX XXXX 's duties to us as a client when refusing to disburse the funds, as well as a breach in the loan commitment from XXXX XXXX.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

446,"Hello, I recently signed up for a new Citi Premier card ( ending in XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. The information packet I received with the card indicated I was not eligible for the sign up bonus of XXXX points after spending {$4000.00} in 3 months because I either "" earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a Citi Rewards+, XXXX XXXX  Preferred, Premier, or Prestige in the past 24 months '' However, I keep very diligent records and see that the last XXXX  card I earned a signup bonus was a previous XXXX XXXX card which I opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending XXXX ), for which I received the bonus points in XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached XXXX  points history, and note that the name listed is XXXX XXXX because that is my maiden name ), which would mean the 24 months has since passed between then and my newest application. 

Of note, I have converted products from that Premier card ( which ended XXXX ) to a Preferred in XX/XX/XXXX, and then to a Rewards+ recently in XX/XX/XXXX, but I never closed any of those XXXX   cards. 

As such, I have neither earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a XXXX  product within the last 24 months and should be eligible for the bonus on this new XXXX  Premier card. 

When I called Citi to explain this issue, it came to my attention that the representative saw an apparent previous Citi Premier card opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending in XXXX ). This is a Citi Premier card opened by my HUSBAND, not by me. I believe that during my application for my Premier card ( ending XXXX ) that I accidentally put in my husband 's SSN rather than my own, and I had to call the application department to correct the application. However, it appears that this original mistake is what caused my new account to be flagged as ineligible for the sign up bonus, due to the original SSN linked to the application to be associated with a recently opened XXXX product. I assumed this would be a simple mistake to correct, and was told the situation would be explained to the "" back office '' and that I would receive a letter resolving the issue. However, I have since received a letter stating that I am still ineligible because I was requesting a "" new account offer [ be ] applied to [ my ] existing account, '' and that new offers are only available on new accounts. 

This completely misses the point that the original offer should have been applied to the new account but was erroneously not-applied due to a mistake on Citi 's part. I am not trying to apply a new-card bonus to an existing card ; I am trying to have a wrongfully refused new-card bonus properly credited to a new-card. 

I have since tried repeatedly calling in to explain the insanity of this response by Citi, but am unable to speak to a human and get hung up on by the computer system.",Closed with non-monetary relief,1,1,1

I also received the email from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that I have successfully got enrolled in this offer. Please see the attached figure for the offer details.

To get the offered bonus of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles, the banker asked me to complete two required activities : ( 1 ) deposit at least {$1000.00} into checking account and at least {$14000.00} into saving account by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 ) maintain the balance in the account for 60 consecutive calendar days following the date when the deposit was made. Then, the bonus will be deposited to my XXXX account within 90 calendar days from the date when I complete the above required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed. 

3. Therefore, following the bank 's guidance : ( 1 ) on XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited {$2000.00} new money to my new checking account and {$14000.00} new money into my savings account. ( 2 ) The total balance of {$16.00}, 000 was maintained in my accounts from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, which is way over 60 days. As a result, I completed the required qualifying activities to be eligible for the offered bonus and should receive the bonus by XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. However, I did not receive the bonus by then. So I contacted the Citi Bank by phone twice in XX/XX/XXXX and the representative told me they would reward me the bonus miles by the middle of XX/XX/XXXX. But, the bonus did not come XX/XX/XXXX.

Another banker who talked to us confirmed that I ameligible for the bonus and made another investigation request ( Reference number : XXXX ). She also got my XXXX XXXX account number to be deposited. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the result was exactly the same as that XXXX. 

7. I definitely can not accept the results from Citibank and do believe should get the XXXX bonus miles, because : ( 1 ) I completely followed the guidance from the banker who opened new accounts for me and got me enrolled in this offer and completed all the required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed.

452,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted 2 disputes, relative to a reservation and stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, to my credit card company, Citibank. The original reservation was lost by the vendor and we were given horribly substandard accommodations which were significantly worse than what had been advertised. This was despite being assured multiple times by the hotel that the accommodations would be comparable, once they determined that they had mistakenly reserved us for one year later. We were not allowed to view the accommodations, until the time of check-in, which was at closing time for management. We immediately presented proof to the hotel reception staff that the accommodations we were given were far inferior to what had been advertised at the time of reservation. We were not given an opportunity to discuss this with management, despite multiple efforts and multiple assurances from the reception staff, that we would be given an opportunity and a monetary adjustment would be made. At checkout, the hotel would not give us an invoice to see the charges, and again denied us the opportunity to speak with management. They made multiple assurances throughout out stay that management would contact us immediately to discuss this. 

At the time of submission of a request for chargeback to Citibank, according to their instructions, and in good faith, I provided a detailed letter of what had occurred and my failed attempts to speak with the management. I provided a prodigious amount of photo documentation and descriptions, including square footage, showing what had been advertised and reserved through XXXX, and what was actually provided. 
The dispute was divided into 2 separate charges, since I initially paid XXXX XXXX a portion of the total at the time of reservation in XX/XX/XXXX. The second charge was made to my Citibank Credit Card, without any further authorization, at the time of checkout, XX/XX/XXXX. The hotel refused to give me an invoice or allow me to speak with management at the time of checkout. As I was instructed, I submitted both disputes via email to dispute department at Citibank, XXXX  

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank sent an electronic message and posted a reply for the second charge. It was dated 3 days after the message itself was dated. Two messages were posted for the same chargeback. The second dispute was missing. I contacted the dispute department and was told that I should immediately sign and send back the response form, in order to have the dispute continued further. I pointed out that only one dispute number was posted, and they assured me that they were not aware of this and would post the second dispute within 48 hours. I received the second response over a week later. In responses, the vendor simply provided a signed key receipt as proof that I had agreed to pay for the rooms provided. I had not agreed to anything except that I would be given a comparable suite and on that basis, I signed for the key. I was given the key receipt prior to being able to see the substandard room. No monetary amount was noted or agreed to on the Hotel 's documentation. No signed invoice was provided, because I was never given one. In the hotels response, they alleged that I had discussed this with them when I had not. 

When I called Citibank, I was told that I should send any additional information that would prove that the accommodations provided were not the ones for which I had agreed to pay. I explained that I had already submitted these, but would be happy to resubmit them. They responded that I did not need to resubmit the information I had already submitted. I was told that the charges would continue to be reversed until further information and the signed responses were received and a resolution was done. On XX/XX/XXXX, on Citibanks secured server, I submitted signed response letters for each of the disputes with detailed letters rebutting the vendors allegations. In the letter, I referred to the previously submitted documentation and offered to re-send it if necessary. It appeared that none of my copious documentation had been reviewed by Citibank Disputes Department and that Citibank was willing to believe the extremely scant documentation provided by the hotel. 

On XXXX, when preparing to pay my bill, I noted that the charges still appeared on my statement. I had received only emails stating that they had received my additional information and would be contacting me soon. I made multiple calls to Citibank over several hours and was disconnected after a recorded statement that was made that all agents were busy. I checked the website messages and no further messages appeared regarding the status of either of these disputes. I finally got through, explained the situation to the agent, and she said that someone from disputes would contact me within 48 hours on my cellphone to update me further. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email alert that a letter was available in messages on the website. I found two letters, once again referring to the same dispute, but not referring to the other dispute. It stated that since I had not provided any information proving that the services rendered were not the ones delivered, that the dispute was considered resolved and the chargeback was reversed. I have spent hours trying to re-contact Citibank to get some explanation of this decision and to find out if they had indeed reviewed all of the documentation I submitted. I have been repeatedly disconnected. 

If the credit card company resolves a dispute, I should be able to understand the basis on which they did so. I should able to confirm that they received and have thoroughly reviewed the documentation that I submitted. I understand that the CoVid19 crisis makes it difficult to contact the company, however this should not be an excuse for their making a decision, clearly without having reviewed my evidence or not clearly explaining their reasons for making the decision despite copious evidence on my part and invalid evidence on the part of the vendor. 


Please note that the attachments I have provided, are identical for both disputes, numbers : XXXX and XXXX. Therefore, rather than duplicate, I will send only one set. The first XXXX photos depict the original listing 900 square foot 1 bedroom villa, which was the basis for my making the reservation and deposit. Photos 1-12 show the room which was given to us, which was less than 1/2 the size of what we contracted for ; very dark, unventilated due to the lack of privacy and need to keep the bedroom windows closed, and very loud due to the location next to a common walkway and with the front door across from the bed, at the top of a common stairway.

453,"On XX/XX/XXXX ( before my payment due date ) I called in to CitiBank to see if they had any available programs in reference to Coronavirus or COVID19. I was transferred around until I landed on an agent that supposedly could help. I explicitly stated that I could pay my regular bill at the time. I was simply calling in to see if they had any deferment programs so that i could save my cash to use for groceries and such. The agent said she understood and offered to defer my payments and cancel my autopay on both of my accounts. I gladly accepted. 

A few days later I received an email that I had missed a payment. I checked my app and was shown that both of my accounts were labelled as past due, with a late fee attached. I called in immediately to rectify the situation. The first agent I spoke with said that there was no program in place, that they had only received communication of possible programs upcoming, and so the previous representative had spoken in error. I requested a supervisor. Again was told that the initial representative was wrong and there was nothing they could do about it. At this point, I was unworried about the deferred payment but the late fee and the impact on my credit score for having 2 accounts showing a missed payment. I have no missed payments on my credit history. I was told by the supervisor that I shouldn't worry about it, a lot of people are going through things right now and they're sure it will all be handled, just give it time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the late fee on my Citi DoubleCash card was refunded. I noted on XX/XX/XXXX that the late fee was still showing on my Citi American Airline AAdvantage card. I called in at XXXX and after explaining the situation to the initial rep, was transferred to a supervisor. He told me that they would not remove the late fee and there was nothing he could do about it. I explained again, in detail, the situation that led to the late fee in the first place : That I had the funds to make the payments but was erroneously advised by a representative of CitiBank that my payments were deferred and so was under the false understanding that I did not have to make the payment. He still refused to remove the late fee. 

At this time I am requesting the removal of the late fee and the assurance that the ( 2 ) missed  payments will not show on my credit report as the late payment was due to professional negligence and false information provided by a Citi representative/employee, with me, as the consumer, relying on their expertise to guide my payment decision.",Closed with monetary relief,0,0,0

Not only does this lack of information fail to satisfy the criteria for proof of debt validation, but I believe the inquiries were obtained and recorded on my credit file under false pretenses. 

I was the victim of a horrible identity theft incident in XX/XX/XXXX, and most of my private information was compromised and exposed. Not to mention, much of my personal information was leaked in the recent XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX breaches. Anyone could have stolen my personal information from the internet and used it fraudulently. I have also tried contacting the credit bureau by phone to dispute the inquiries but the representatives insist that the inquiries have been verified, without providing any definitive proof. I have also contacted each creditor and informed them that the inquiries are fraudulent. The inquiries are as follows : XXXX  XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX  XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I would like for the unauthorized hard inquiries to be permanently deleted and completely removed from my credit file.",Closed with non-monetary relief,1,1,1
463,"Dear Investigator, Thank you for taking your time to help me resolve this problem. 
Background : Prior to XXXX XXXX - Contacted by fraudster claiming to be XXXX XXXX. They left a message, I did not return the phone call and contacted XXXX, they confirmed it was fraud, I took no further action. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I received a letter from XXXX XXXX  notifying me that a CC application had been submitted with my name and SSN. This was fraud. I contacted XXXX XXXX and they cancelled the request and suggested I call Experian and have a Fraud Alert placed on my credit report. I did as instructed. 
The Problem - There is not a person I was able to speak to at Experian. The automated system is unwieldy, confusing and unhelpful. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to put a Fraud Alert on my credit report. Instead the automated system put a Freeze on my Credit. I do not want a Freeze on my credit. The automated system gave me pin number very rapidly and the signal broke up. I was unable to write down that number or even hear most of it. I was unable to get the automated system to repeat the number. Now my credit is frozen and I have no way to unfreeze it. 
The Damage - I am not longer a citizen with the right to finance a car, home, education, or short term loan for emergencies or entrepreneurial opportunity. The damage that I have experienced is significant and I see no way to rectify this for the rest of my life if I can not speak to a person at Experian. The credit reporting agencies should be required to have personnel available to answer the phone so that the agencies do not strip citizens of their right to have credit with no fault of the citizen.",Closed with non-monetary relief,1,1,1

So ... even though my credit score at the time of my house closing in XX/XX/XXXX was XXXX ... .and even though I have been approved for a car loan, dump truck loan, office purchase loan of XXXX, and a track hoe loan through lending institutions, and even though my payments to XXXX XXXX on my XXXX credit limit card have always been made 20 days or more in advance ... .and even though all of my bank payments have been on time, auto draft ... ..and even though all my building accounts are current ... .you XXXX XXXX were able to drop my score 93 points for missing a payment I did not even know existed.

I will work to get your business removed from XXXX XXXX ... no matter how many rounds of golf and drinks you have together. 
The whole XXXX system is rigged against you. The only thing that should matter is your payments being made on time. 
And why does it take months and years to build credit ... .and five seconds to destroy it ... .and why has my score been going down as I have been acquiring more credit. The XXXX tell you that getting new credit raises your score ... ..they lie. And they are able to judge your score without even knowing your debt to income ratio ... I mean if whats more important ... .your use of credit level % ... ..or your ability to pay it off???? 
What in the XXXX does credit shopping have to do with a credit score????? I????????? 
If you don't take on new debt, or too much debt ... .maybe there is nothing wrong. 
We should be rewarded for shopping around for credit ... .not punished. 
What is the XXXX does maxing out your line of credit on occasion have to do with being a credit risk???????????????????? 
How can you allow anyone to drop your score by 93 points for missing a payment you don't even know you are supposed to make. I caught it up immediately ... .but the damage is done. And now with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Coronavirus ... ..that SBA loan and my house refinance that would save us {$500.00} dollars a month on our house payment and lower our debt to equity ratio ... .my ability to survive on the back side of this disaster I had nothing to do with??? I will do to you what you did to me but with the idea that you do not stay in business. How many jobs would that be at XXXX XXXX  ... .you win one law suit ... and all the others come out of the woodworks ... .right?? Class action ... social media posting ... .an evening news cast ( TV ) portraying what you do to people??? / I will eventually testify before Congress and I will make sure I make the networks allow me to tell others about you. 
I also have a XXXX account at XXXX XXXX ... ..which I was lied to about. 
XXXX XXXX told me I was opening a builders account ... ..like I have at 4 other material suppliers. They never mentioned it was a credit card ... .lying XXXX 's. 
Even worse ... .XXXX  only allows autopay to be set up directly to your checking account. They will not take a credit card payment ... .meaning I don't get to collect and make points from my XXXX  payment through XXXX  XXXX XXXX  payments ... ..like the XXXX miles that flew my wife and kids to my wife 's home country of XXXX for XXXX XXXX .without points, impossible. For that reason ... XXXX XXXX looses about {$100000.00} in business from me a year. I have 5 other builder accounts. The only reason I shop at XXXX is either job site convenience ... .or the other suppliers don't carry what XXXX  does. 
So ... .never mind my perfect payment history ... perfect. Never mind I did not even know that I was supposed to pay this account. Never mind that XXXX  chooses to stay in the ice age and not set up auto pay through means other than bank draft. 
XXXX would not play nice ... .so we are going to ding him 93 points in one 30 day reporting period for being 30 days late?????????? 
Oh my XXXX ... the algorithms say his in distress, he is in trouble ... .he is going down ... .lets down grade him. Lets not find out what the XXXX is actually going on ... .lets not tell him that we were calling on a separate account he did not know he even had ... .both in XXXX XXXX  ... .lets just drop his score right when his XXXX taxes are fixing to be done and filed ... and he is going to refinance his house ... and he needs an SBA assistance loan to survive the Coronavirus .... XXXX you all and may it be done unto you as you do to others. You punish those who do right for the sins ( thats why you make the rules ... the sins of others ) of others.

How arrogant a system who relies on blind algorithm and rules instead of checking in to see what is going on. 
Its like relying on math to see if your kids are ok, rather than getting off your XXXX XXXX XXXX to just walk into the bedroom, kiss them good night ... and talk to them in person. 
Its like firing someone bases on what an algorithm says, rather than any basis or reason. Oh ... the math was not in favor for you today ... .you are fired ... .you are chosen to die. 
And since when does shopping for credit mean you are desperate??????? Lets see ... .oh ... they use of credit combined with shopping ... the math says thats dangerous and desperate ... .so lets punish him. 
Anyway ... ..93 points in a 30 day reporting period short of not making any payments and filing for bankruptcy ... .is stupid, arcane, arrogant ... and criminal. You are either with me or against me in this fight. 
I just won out all by myself against XXXX XXXX trying to bully me on XXXX XXXX, lying on what my bank statement showed ... .and I got a full refund. They thought they could win too.They transferred me to 8 different people in 6 different office locations over 8 months, each time making me start the complaint process over again and threatening to put it on my credit.

If you have any XXXX power or can actually do something ... .then please give me a call. Otherwise ... don't waste my time ... and pass me along to someone who can do something.

She at some point said she was having difficulty hearing me but then seemed like she understood the reason for my call. She explained that if I did not wish for the XXXX to renew they could mail me a check and specified the amount that would be mailed to me ( which I later learned was not even the 2.5 % interest amount which I had originally agreed to ).

In fact, I have not cashed the check yet from Citibank because theoretically the funds should have remained in the XXXX  until XX/XX/2020 and I fully intended to keep the funds there until maturity.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.

If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

499,"XX/XX/2020 I found out my account was negative {$100.00} and there were 2 pending Overdraft fees.

Due to this fee, I had 4 transactions ( less than {$20.00} each ) that made my balance go negative. I believe more overdraft fees will be posted soon. I know its perfectly legal for banks to rearrange transactions to maximize overdraft fees. If this happens I am responsible for the fees. Banks should also be held accountable if it was the other way around. They charged overdraft when my account was not over withdrawn and because of that overdraft fee being charge, 4 transactions went into the negative causing at least 2 more overdraft fees which are currently pending. I called and spoke to the bank but for some reason the computer wouldnt allow him to reverse the posted overdraft fee. This is not right.

I have tried calling in to make a payment, but hold times are easily over an hour. I have called multiple times now and each call has been over an hour long and I get through to nobody. 

They have revoked automated payment system because it is delinquent. So I am unable to call and use the automated payment system to make a payment. 

They have revoked online payment so I can not pay my mortgage online either. 

I have went to a branch, but they only will take cash or a check. I have been doing a transfer payment for 5 years now, and now they will not take it. I am unable to draw the {$1500.00} I was go pay from an ATM for obvious reasons. 

I, and many others, have been waiting endlessly on hold and getting nowhere. I have reached out to a branch, their twitter account that supposed to be for 24/7 customer support is not responding, the bank refuses to do a transfer. 

The options they have given me and all others is must pay cash or check, fill out a form to have them call you which will do no good because I will be in contact with a loan officer, they say to pay online or over the phone but you can't do that because of wait times and them locking people out of paying that way. 

Wells Fargo should not even be allowed to be in business.

Like when they made all those bank accounts illegally in other peoples names, or helping cause the market crash in 2008, or even here in Colorado holding paperwork until it's late to hold the interest rate ransom. 

I am just trying to pay my mortgage and Wells Fargo is doing nothing to help, but everything they can to make it impossible to pay the bill.

In addition, the charge was not even for my vehicle. The correspondence from the third party paying the charge stated it was my vehicle, but it was not. I was merely involved in assisting the party whose vehicle was mistakenly taken by the tow company, which is why the third party paid the charges.

I got this mortgage with a mortgage company that unfortunately sold the mortgage account to the SunTrust Bank, merged today with BB & T and with the new name of Truist. 
I am foreseeing financial hardship in the future because of the Covid-19 crisis, and would like to get to an arrangement with Trusit in case I need help in the next 2 to 3 months with my mortgage payments.

Truist has zero customer service during this pandemic times. The only way to get help with mortgage issues is by calling the number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, but the problem is that my domestic partner and me have been on hold for up to 3 hours in several occasions and we have never been able to reach a representative. 
We turned to the community and all other clients of Truist are experiencing the same problem, some holding for up to 5 hours in a call without ever getting an answer.

The few cases we know that got through after many hours, are extremely disappointed, since all Truist offers is a 90 days forbearance, in other words, people who chooses this option will not pay anything for 3 months, but will have to produce the mortgage payment of all 4 months on the fourth month or will face foreclosure. Is this even legal?

Since calls don't get answered, I went to a branch risking being on the street, emailed their ''customer support '' address and even wrote to them on social media ( XXXX and XXXX ).

The mechanic sent the engine to a machine shop and after a year, the car came back with parts left out of the engine. The mechanic reluctantly installed the parts, and informed me he was going out of business. He returned the car to me at the end of XXXX when he was closing his doors. The car overheats and will not run for more than about 15 miles on the freeway without losing all coolant, with the overflow bottle blowing out and steam everywhere. There is also an engine knock and low oil pressure. When I complained to the mechanic in an email ( attached ), he referred me to the machine shop ( attached ), with whom I had no contract. The machine shop blamed the problems on the mechanic ( attached ). As three of the four sums I paid to the mechanic were through my Wells Fargo Visa debit card ( {$7000.00} XX/XX/XXXX, {$5900.00} XX/XX/XXXX and {$870.00} XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a merchant dispute. A provisional credit was initially given, but taken back in XXXX. I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying the matter was closed and the dispute denied. Despite that the Wells Fargo documentation correctly describes the dispute as 13.3 Defective/not as described ( XXXX pgs. 7-9 attached ), page two of the XX/XX/XXXX letter I received from XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo ( attached ) describes the situation more as a 10.3 ( i.e. no unauthorized transaction ). I never claimed someone else used my card. Rather I complained the merchant did not perform the work adequately. Moreover, the merchant did not provide documentation proving my car runs properly, In fact, his later of XX/XX/XXXX admits there were problems. The merchant also admits he was "" liquidating his business '' ( which is why I could not go back to him for correction of the problems ). When I asked him in an email ( attached ) for relief he referred me to the machine shop, a third party with whom I have no contract and who refuses to take any responsibility. I paid the mechanic, not the machine shop, who the mechanic selected. 

Visa and Wells Fargo seem to have sided with the merchant when no compelling evidence and no third party documentation such as a second opinion letter have been provided by the merchant. I provided a second opinion letter ( attached ) at the direction of Wells Fargo, and this seems to have been ignored. Also, it seems Wells Fargo and perhaps Visa ( no access to Visa is provided by the bank ) changed the dispute from defective merchandise to fraud based on page 2 of the XX/XX/XXXX letter from Wells Fargo "" Based on additional documents from the merchant, it was determined the charges were made by the customer or an authorized person.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message saying they corrected the purchase to 24  month deferred interest and within 24/48 hours, the interest should be refunded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the account for the change. It hadn't been changed and therefore, I sent a message using the same chat feed to ask about the interest charges still showing.

After waiting on hold for 30 minutes a representative came on the line & advised that the department that is able to release the hold on my XXXX payment wasn't in. I advised the rep that I wanted a supervisor/manager to call me about the email I received advising me to call immediately only to find out the department was not in. No one called. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was at work and late morning I received an email, attached, advising that my funds had been released to receiver. I never spoke to the department that was suppose to verify my identity and within the email I had received from BMO Harris on XX/XX/XXXX, attached, it stated that my payment would not be released and would be cancelled if I didn't speak to the department that was not in on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called BMO Harris and was told that nothing could be done. I asked for a supervisor/manager to call me & advised the rep at BMO that I was at work till XXXX XXXX  that day but on XX/XX/XXXX I was off and could accept a call at any time. At XXXX XXXX  I received a call, but couldn't answer as I was at work, and the rep from BMO Harris XXXX left a message stating that she would call me in the morning on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Around XXXX XXXX  I still had not received a call from BMO Harris rep XXXX and called BMO Harris. I spoke with a rep named XXXX who advised that he was messaging XXXX and she would give me a call but she never did. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called BMO Harris around XXXX XXXX  and spoke to a supervisor/manager XXXX who told me that once a XXXX payment had been initiated it could not be cancelled. XXXX was the first rep that ever mentioned this. I asked XXXX then if it could not be cancelled how could I get an email saying if I didn't call to verify my identity that my payment would be cancelled? XXXX said she'd look into everything and call me back on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to XXXX that I worked XXXX and would not be able to answer the phone during those hours so I needed her to call me before XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from BMO Harris never called before XXXX XXXX. Instead she called around XXXX XXXX  and was shocked that I answered the phone. 
XXXX advised that there wasn't anything that could be done. I told XXXX I wanted someone above her to call me on XX/XX/XXXX as this was my day off and could take the call any time that day. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a call around XXXX XXXX from a rep XXXX who said that he was advised to call me before XXXX. I asked XXXX how he got that information because I had said that I could accept a call any time that day. There is no communication within BMO Harris ; not with there customers and not within their organization. XXXX told me that the first rep that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX could not give me all the information about my account because it had to do with the XXXX portion of my account and that department was not in that day. I asked XXXX how it could possibly be that a representative from BMO Harris is not able to give their customers all the necessary information pertaining to their account ; their money, in order for BMO Harris 's customers to be able to make sound decisions about their money that they work for? So basically BMO Harris doesn't think it's necessery to give their customers all the pertinant information about their account so that they can make sound decisions about their finances. I told XXXX I wanted someone above him to call me about this because this does not seem right. 
XXXX told me that someone would give me a call by week 's end, XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I hadn't heard from anyone from BMO Harris and decided to go into the XXXX, IL location. I worked with a banker, XXXX, who said she was going to file an internal complaint about what was happening with the lack of communication about my situation and played the message I had save from XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX stating she'd call me the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX No one from BMO Harris had called so I reached back out to XXXX by phone and she said no one had responded to her about the internal complaint but she would follow-up. 

XX/XX/XXXX No one from BMO Harris has called. I called XXXX at the XXXX, IL BMO Harris location and she told me there was no response. What is going on? No one from BMO Harris cares that their customer is out {$150.00} of their hard earned money. XXXX asked if I would like to have her manager, XXXX, give me a call.

Because of this pending charge on my account and it had just been the XXXX  season I took a look back through my banking transactions and noticed that there were several charges that were not made by me and being that I don't give my debit card out to anyone I called BMO Harris to dispute the transactions that I did not make, which I have attached the denial letters from BMO Harris.

XX/XX/XXXX I called into BMO Harris to dispute my denial letters pertaining to my disputed charges. Spoke with a rep who advised me to send an email & advised me of what to write within the email, attached, while I was on the phone with the rep. 

XX/XX/XXXX I had not heard anything from BMO Harris pertaining to my disputed charges. I went into the BMO Harris branch in XXXX, IL & worked with a banker named XXXX. I wrote a statement disputing my charges again because it didn't appear to XXXX that my email I sent on XX/XX/XXXX had been received. XXXX faxed my denial letter. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called the BMO Harris XXXX, IL branch and spoke with XXXX inquiring about when I was going to hear about my disputing the denial letter that I faxed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX advised that my claim was again denied but that BMO Harris does NOT have to reach out to the customer. So basically the customer has no idea what is going on with their claim. BMO Harris 's customers are just suppose to sit in limbo wondering what is going on with their claim. How could this be? A BMO Harris customer reaches out for help and BMO Harris doesn't bother to respond on the status. And not only that they flat out tell you that they are not going to let their customers know what is going on and that is somehow just suppose to be ok.

During my conversation with the agent, which would certainly be considered a "" communication '' as defined under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 USC 1692a, I was not given the mini-Miranda as required by the Act. I explained to the agent that I temporarily resided at this apartment with my then boyfriend, but that I had no contractual obligation under the lease. However, the agent refused to accept my dispute for investigation. I then requested validation of the debt ; asking that they provide me with an itemization of the balance being charged and some sort of documentation showing my own contractual liability, such as my signature on the lease. The agent refused to honor my request, told me to call back when I was "" ready to pay '' and hung up on me. I've sent a written request for this same validation yet they have continuously refused to provide it, in violation of 15 USC 1692g 809. 

Further, their refusal to adequately investigate my dispute, while continuing to adversely report it to the credit reporting agencies, is a blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 USC 1681 and its subsequent amendment, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ( FACTA ). Under these Acts, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information and the data furnisher has an obligation to investigate that dispute. Inaccurate or unverifiable information must be corrected or deleted by the furnisher. IQ Data International continues to refuse me these rights as required by law. 

This is not my debt. This apartment was rented strictly in the name of my ex-boyfriend, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I never signed any lease for this apartment and have no contractual obligation for this debt if it is even legitimately owed ; which still has yet to be determined. 

My attempts to correct IQ Data 's records and restore my credit with regard to this item have been in vain. Research on this collection agency shows that they are not an active member of XXXX XXXX, nor an accredited business with the XXXX, and that their standard XXXX  complaint responses are both dismissive and uncooperative ... so I guess my failed attempts are not surprising.

588,"This is a request as authorized by the FCRA 611 Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ] This request is regarding the account listed below : XXXX XXXX This account has previously been reported on my credit file and was subsequently deleted after the item was disputed and could not be verified. On XXXX XXXX. I requested a copy of my credit report under my rights through the FACTA act. This item was not contained in my credit file on that date. On XXXX XXXX, after being denied credit for a home student based upon negative information being reported through XXXX  and XXXX. I requested a second copy of my credit report under my rights to review my credit report after denial of credit. The account in question suddenly reappeared on the report dated XX/XX/2020. I immediately completed an online dispute for this account. In response to this dispute you sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2020 ( with confirmation number XXXX ). In this letter it stated that my investigation was completed and that you verified that this item belongs to me. 

I have two problems with the way reporting on this account has been handled by XXXX. First, according to my XX/XX/XXXX credit report, this item was reported in XXXX. Even giving you a very generous assumption that this item was reported to you on XXXX XXXX. I find it very difficult to believe that "" additional information regarding this item '' sufficient enough to prove this is my account could have been provided to you by XX/XX/XXXX, only one day after the account was re-reported to you. Furthermore, I find it very odd that you're letter "" verifying this account '' predates my dispute of this account.

I received no such notification. This is a serious violation of the FCRA, and I reserve the right to pursue further action.
( iii ) Additional information.

589,"I am writing because I have recently been involved with Citibank customer service, trying to clear up some problems with Overdraft and NSF fees incurred over the past month or so in my checking account ( XXXX ). From XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXXthe account incurred {$270.00} in fees, some of which have since been reversed. The account is currently overdrawn by - {$86.00} and two more fees are about to be assessed for transactions on the XXXX and the XXXX of XXXX. The problem is that the overdrawn amount is all in fees. In fact, looking at the history of the account, the fees are simply creating more and more fees. 

As of three days ago, for example, my account should have been back in the black. I talked via Online Chat to an agent about two fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and one fee on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX a total of {$100.00} ). At the end of the chat, the agent told me ( I quote precisely from the conversation ), I have reversed the fees for you and it will be credited to your account in 24-48 hours. That did not happen. Had it happened, the two recent transactions of XX/XX/XXXX and 21, the ones about to generate NSF fees, would have been covered. Yesterday, when I discovered that the three charges my online Chat agent said would be reversed were not reversed, I started another online Chat but was directed to call Customer Service. After waiting for 1 1/2 hours on hold, I was finally connected to a Supervisor. I tried to explain to her the circumstances of my Chat, hoping to correct the fact that the fees were not yet reversed. I also pointed out that it was getting to be a situation I could not handle because of the loss of work due to the Coronavirus shutdown and my thinly stretched resources. I also let her know that I thought my situation was unfair because it seemed that fees were just creating more fees. We got into just one example, a {$34.00} overdraft fee assessed on XX/XX/XXXX, a fee caused by the Monthly Service Fee of {$12.00}. This is a fee that the bank offered to and did waive as part of their effort to be mindful of and helpful with customers at this time when many of us are facing economic hardship. Before I could even get into the total situation or figure out why the fees I was told were going to be reversed were not, the Supervisor said, No, no, we dont have to waive that fee for you even though it was caused by the fee that the bank is waiving. Her tone was appallingly rude, so I asked her for her name, which she said so quickly that I couldnt understand it. Then, just as quickly, she hung up on me. This made me a little suspicious. Why wouldnt she explain why my fees werent reversed as described? And, are banks legally allowed to generate fee charges from fee charges that are later reversed? 

I looked again through my ledger and noted a few things. The first Overdraft Fee in this chain was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00}. The bank reversed these fees on XX/XX/XXXX. This caused the account to become overdrawn by {$33.00}. If that money had been in the account, the next two NSF fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX payment of {$60.00} would not have been assessed because there would have been enough to cover the payment. ( These fees were paid when I deposited {$290.00} in the account on XX/XX/XXXX ). The next set of fees ( {$34.00} each ) comes on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX for another XXXX XXXX XXXX paymen of {$60.00}. I had made the deposit of {$290.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, trying to make sure this was all covered, but it ended up not being enough because the {$34.00} NSF fee was assessed retroactively to that day, so I couldnt have known about it when I made the deposit. Then the last Overdraft fee appears XX/XX/XXXX, a fee that was, as stated above, caused by the monthly service charge, which itself was waived. Finally, there are the two charges about to be assessed. 

I must say, I was really hoping to have all these charges reversed because charges that were deemed reversible caused other charges to occur. In real time, I was trying to keep up with these charges by refuting them and having them reversed and even by depositing enough money to cover them. The situation of fees causing other fees has had a domino effect on the account that I simply will not be able to recover from at this time while we are all under lock-down. I still do not know why the charges that were going to be reversed were not. But all this has certainly worked to the banks advantage. In a month, they would be making off of me 22 times the monthly service charge! Besides thinking that there is something wrong with they way they are creating and assessing fees, I also found the Supervisor with whom I spoke uninterested in my issues to the point of being rude and obstructive as well as completely insensitive to anything happening to Americans as a result of the Coronavirus, this despite Citibanks posturing to act as though it is interested in being helpful.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information
( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX  XXXX | XX/XX/2019 I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

618,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Closed with non-monetary relief,1,1,1

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

629,"To Whom it Should Concern, We received the second investigative response that no corrections would be made for our escalation. We understand that regulation allows you to commit to a rate lock but allows terms that you can later change. However, as far as customer service we do not feel this was fully investigated. There were a number of things that were mishandled in our mortgage process. I have provided a timeline and copies of emails to support. Its concerning to be notified that NOTHING was found to be incorrect from a customer service perspective and feel very strongly we were given a loan under false pretenses. Additionally, from the time that this began XXXX, XXXX boss informed us that the Executive team would not change anything. This process has proven that to be very true. 
We have not had anything further explained, the internal investigation explained, or even a new agent changed despite a request by phone to the escalations team, the 800 general number, or reaching out to our local branch. Our trust and confidence with Wells Fargo at this point is non-existent. Because of the lack of communication and resolution, well be sharing this with the VA and XXXX XXXX XXXX as well since this is the second internal investigation with the same conclusion. Were being asked to submit a third. We have little faith that this will be fairly investigated and resolved. 

Timeline of Poor Customer Experience from Wells Fargo ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX Received confirmation of 3.25 % interest rate from XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX we received the emails to start the application process with WF and an email from XXXX with the preapproval letter. We submit the requested information. 
XXXX XXXX requests additional information. We provide within 24 hours. 
XXXX The pre-approval letter received does not contain the discussed interest amount and requires a down payment. XXXX follows up after a phone discussion to get the updated letter. XXXX confirms he is working on it. 
XXXX XXXX responds back to the same email stating that hes still working on the pre-approval letter but rates are different than what he first stated. 
XXXX Receive first email from XXXX XXXX requesting additional documentation for closing. The same day we answer questions and start requesting documents. 
XXXX Requested Tax Forms are sent via secure email. 
XXXX Additional documents are requested. The offer letter is requested for XXXX XXXX, the company relocating is XXXX XXXX and provided via email. W9s are signed and returned. This is also the first request for rental statements, XXXX sends an XXXX file downloaded from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 12 months. 
XXXX XXXX informs us that the XXXX sheet for rental payments is not sufficient. Outlines what she believes the underwriter will need. XXXX reaches out to XXXX XXXX to request statements for 12 months as they are not available online that far back. 
XXXX We receive an application update to sign the Intent to Proceed. We let XXXX know that XXXX has not yet updated the pre-approval with the correct interest rate for us to proceed. 
XXXX On XXXX, since we still do not have the 3.25 % locked we provide XXXX with a pre-approval letter from another lender who is also approved for direct bill for relocation closing costs. 
XXXX XXXX follows up to see where XXXX is with the updated rate. 
XXXX XXXX replies that the 3.25 % is confirmed. XXXX states that a new pre-approval can not be generated and provides us with a rate lock document. 
XXXX Janeine emails XXXX and XXXX to ask if the rate lock period will be extended from XX/XX/XXXX since the rate is new and just sent on XXXX. XXXX states that they lowered the rate and it can not be changed, we would have to pay to extend. We inform the other bank that we will be proceeding with Wells Fargo. The clock is now ticking. 
XXXX XXXX provides 12 months of XXXX statements and check numbers for payments made from checking account for requested rent verification via secure email. 
XXXX Email sent from XXXX XXXX introducing herself as our loan processor and requesting additional information. 
XXXX Information is returned within 24 hours. XXXX informs us that we now need 24 months of rent proof. 
XXXX XXXX  offers to reach out to the landlord to get a letter stating payments on time. XXXX suggests waiting to see if the underwriter accepts 12 months. 
XXXX Documents requested through secure mail. Send XXXX an email outlining what we previously discussed that documents were loaded on XXXX. He states he will follow up with XXXX ( shes not copied ). 
XXXX XXXX provides updates on the requested information ( His comments in parenthesis ). States he will follow up with a call once he has the forms we were not provided. Please note which requested items he stated are NOT needed. 
XXXX XXXX sends follow up email to XXXX as we have not heard back on the previous email or received required forms. 
XXXX We receive conditional approvals with another list of requested documents. It finally includes the VA Questionnaire and Amendatory Clause. As well as numerous requests for information we already submitted, clarified or were told we no longer needed. 
XXXX XXXX responds to the errors with the following note. XXXX replies that she will hold on further documentation requests until she hears back from XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX responds via secure mail to the initial request asking for landlord information instead. XXXX sends it to her. 
XXXX XXXX sends an email through XXXX to update the to do list. Again we are told to disregard some of the requests. We return the VA and Amendatory forms the same day they are sent to us. 
XXXX We request a breakdown of closing costs and return the documents for HOA costs via XXXX  email. 
XXXX XXXX sends an amended list of items still remaining, inclusive of the rate lock and closing dates. Half of them we were given different updates and direction from XXXX on. Specificially : Number 3 we were told to disregard. XXXX is relocating.

Number 5, we already explained and XXXX was following up with the underwriter. These would be done AFTER the sale of the house.

Number 12, we provided the name and email address of our landlord to XXXX at this point. 
XXXX XXXX responds through secured mail following me calling her to understand the repeat requests. I reply back with answers. She then asks for XXXX most recent paystub. 
XXXX XXXX informs XXXX that she can not confirm my employment with XXXX XXXX. I had just started on XXXX so the 3rd party did not have my information. I provided her information for the HR team that I worked with and it was verified via phone the same day. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX document sent as requested via secure mail. 
XXXX XXXX Paystub sent as requested via secure email. 
XXXX Request for XXXX to be resent the link for secured email as he does not have access. XXXX responds that he will have XXXX send. Sends via XXXX. 
XXXX We received the direct bill closing cost estimate requested on XXXX. 
XXXX Receive another loan tracker update of missing documents. Email via XXXX to request information be updated as documents were already submitted via secure mail. Receive a response back from XXXX that he will get them cleared out. 
XXXX Receive another update via secured email from XXXX requesting already submitted or incorrect information. Receive a response back from XXXX that he will follow up directly with XXXX. XXXX then requests to speak with us regarding the items requested by XXXX. XXXX speaks with him and he apologizes on XXXX behalf stating this is the first time theyve worked together. 
XXXX Upload remaining requested items based on phone conversation with XXXX with the exception of XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX Send requested XXXX XXXX information via secured email. 
XXXX Follow up via email with XXXX to confirm she got all the documents already submitted. She responds with items that WELLS FARGO needs to complete. She states that she still needs verification from the landlord and the Amendatory Clause back from the sellers agent. She reaches out for the first time on XX/XX/XXXX and the sellers closing agent returns it the same day. She confirms she has not yet reached out to the landlord despite being provided information on XXXX. This is now 20 days later. 
XXXX XXXX is now also requesting a letter from Harrys employer stating hes allowed to work from home and his pay will not be changing, though his role is not changing at all. 
XXXX Despite follow up, no additional responses or updates from Wells Fargo. 
XXXX Receive email around XXXX XXXX EST from XXXX letting us know that we need to return final documents by end of day to close on time. Send email to XXXX and inform her that he lives in XXXX which is why we provided email. Send a follow up email to XXXX asking him to respond as quickly as he can, despite it being XXXX XXXX. XXXX confirmed. 
XXXX Receive an email from XXXX stating he will follow back up with the underwriter. Respond at XXXX to XXXX clarifying XXXX work situation again. Receive request for a letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX   manager instead. 
XXXX Receive the following email at XXXX EST stating that if we dont provide the information we will need to push back closing on XX/XX/XXXX. Not a lot of time to provide new information like a number from a landlord in XXXX or a letter from an employer on a Friday afternoon. 
XXXX Extremely concerned we reached out to XXXX and XXXX by phone and neither answered. We send the following email : XXXX I would like to request that further follow ups take place over the phone and followed up with emails in the essence of time. Either of us can be available by cell phone. 
We have submitted information promptly and repeatedly since the start of this process. It would be extremely disappointing if we have to push back our close date due to delays we did not cause. 
We provided my landlord 's email address weeks ago so not sure why we are just reaching out this week. Our landlord ( he ) is in XXXX, so not certain he will respond today. I will go online and download as many statements as I can in the interim and upload them to the tracker. If we need to request from XXXX XXXX the turnaround will be 48 hours at least. 
For the work location- again it is not changing from the XXXX XXXX NJ address. XXXX is reaching out to his boss to see if a letter can quickly be drafted to reiterate what we have explained via email and phone. 
I would not have guessed that with healthy credit scores and incomes that could singularly support the mortgage we were approved for, this would be such an undertaking. We have a lot of other things ( temp housing, move dates ) hinged on this closing date. 
XXXX could you please follow up with XXXX as soon as you're available? 
XXXX Around XXXX I sent copies of rent checks manually pulled from the online site to XXXX XXXX They were sent via email for XXXX and XXXX because the loan tracker was completed and there was no where to upload. He responded back requesting a call. 
XXXX During our call, XXXX personally apologized for the email from XXXX and stated that hed spoken to her and advised that she should not have sent a note threating to push the closing date back. He then followed up with an email at XXXX just before close of business. A very stressful day for the both of us while at work. 
XXXX XXXX  promptly responds to our email stating hes traveling but will respond on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. We advise that theres no need. 
XXXX XXXX responds to an email we sent on XX/XX/XXXX asking about a new to-do item on the loantracker. We are informed we need to sign the VA form for XXXX. 
NOTE : This form was sent to him on XXXX by XXXX. This is also the date that Wells Fargo was notified of the regulation changes from the VA. 
XXXX We receive an email from XXXX confirming we have closed. 
XXXX Notified at XXXX by XXXX XXXX that the Survey fee direct billed could not be covered by the company and the closing cost we were sent had increased by XXXX. This is the first time we were notified. Respond at XXXX with company approval to cover the cost. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reaches out to XXXX via phone to inform him 3 days before closing that the loan can only be financed 95 %. This leaves ONE business day before closing on Monday the XXXX. An ENTIRE WEEK after the new loan rates were released by the VA. 2 days after Wells Fargo made the LTV adjustment. 1 day after on loan was approved. Had we been notified in a TIMELY manner, we could have had our previous bank process the loan. 

Escalations Process with Wells Fargo : XXXX An escalation started with speaking to XXXX boss XXXX XXXX He stated that he would escalate to the Executive Board of Complaints but "" he wouldn't expect a positive result from their review '' which was disheartening to both of us. These again, are words from YOUR representatives.

An escalations resolution specialist followed up, XXXX XXXX, stating that it would take a few weeks to review and follow up. Not in time for our closing. During the call with XXXX, he was again treated as though we were at fault for this egregious error and lack of accurate information provided to me. I was told that my complaint and concern was simply another case that needed to be reviewed and that there was nothing that could be done to help me before my approaching closing date. 

We were sent a survey during this, which XXXX completed and received notification that the case was being re-reviewed. 

XXXX We received a letter from XXXX stating the resolution. There were a number of misstated or misinformed assertions made : 1. You chose to lock your rate at 3.375 % on XX/XX/XXXX. False. Once presented, we asked for an update sheet with the correct percentage. 
XXXX. The lock rate was communicated as of XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX. Further, documents show us following up for the correct interest rate to be communicated on XX/XX/XXXX and documents being incorrect until XXXX when he came back with the correct interest rate because we produced an approval letter from another lender who could honor what he initially promised.

3. The letter states we were provided a request for additional information on XX/XX/XXXX. As the email trail shows, we provided all original documentation within 24 of asks. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent an email stating he was getting with the loan processor to understand was TRULY needed as she was asking for documents that we had already provided or not relevant to our situation ( example : relocation information for XXXX who was NOT the person using relocation benefits. Janeines company was providing ).

4. We understand that the processes take time and require additional information but even XXXX, YOUR representative spoke about the processors errors and incompetence and had to follow up multiple times to clarify, review our situation and what still needs to be collected. This is NOT what we expect from a company as large and established as Wells Fargo. This is our frustration with the documentation process- Proactive, timely documents were completed on our side only to be met with requests for new information, the same information again, or information not relevant to our loan. If you dont find any issue with that in your review thats even more unfortunate than this lack of investigation. This was the case until XXXX the Friday before closing. Please see the timeline for proof.

5. We have determined the account was handled properly and no corrections are needed as no error has occurred. And this is why we will be sharing with the VA and XXXX XXXX XXXX. More alarming than your lack of true escalation and investigation is the fact that per your document, XXXX and XXXX follow the process exactly as your company directs. If that is the case we want everyone to know what to expect when working with Wells Fargo on a mortgage. 
Early XXXX During a call to escalate our dissatisfaction with still being assigned to XXXX XXXX, XXXX was transferred from account services to XXXX XXXX. She stated that I could not request an advisor change I would need to reach out directly to XXXX manager. We left a voicemail for XXXX and received no response. When we reviewed Janeines additional concerns with their findings, she stated she did not think the lag in notification was an error on Wells Fargos part and would reinvestigate my assertion that even XXXX admitted errors were made. 

XXXX We receive a cover letter stating that after review, no additional investigation is deemed necessary. XXXX was called the same day by XXXX XXXX stating that she would reopen the case. As of XX/XX/XXXX, this has not occurred. 

The worst part of this situation isnt the painful process, the surprise ending, or the lack of care about customer service identified by leadership and the complaint board. The entire point of the VA loan was 100 % financing and expanded limits. This was promised to us from the start, finally put in writing with the threat of not using Wells Fargo, and then defended across the organization with not one solution proposed to ease the pain even after the loan closed. Were not only stuck with a loan that doesnt achieve what the VA set it up to do, but leaves us with the same advisor as the person who put us in the situation to begin with. 
Regardless of regulation, a delay in conveying the new parameters set by Wells Fargo ( not legislation ) robbed us of the opportunity to select a different lender without risk of losing a home we loved. This lack of honesty and deceptive business practice cost us the ability to select a lender and loan that truly met our needs. The Wells Fargo team who handled our loan was unprofessional and lacked knowledge throughout the process causing us distress as we were forced to resend countless documents due to being told inaccurate information or simply because the documents had been lost by our loan officer or his team. Due to Wells Fargo 's lack of honesty on their policy of fully financing VA Loans at 100 % I was given an inaccurate closing cost estimate provided by Loan Officer of {$36000.00}. 
As a veteran and second time customer of Wells Fargo I have never been so disappointed in my life in this entire experience. The lack of honesty and character shown by this group in response to this internal mistake is alarming and our fear that this treatment could be given to other veterans simply looking to purchase homes, as well who trust the Wells Fargo team to give them accurate information throughout the home buying process. Not at all the intention of the loan program.",Closed with monetary relief,0,0,1
