9,04/13/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"The Credit reports from the three predominant credit report institutions have been systematically and consistently reporting that I have have serious delinquencies affecting substantially my credit record and my ability to find low interest rates on credit cards, student loans, car loans mortgages. 
I have been continuously paying my debts since XX/XX/XXXX and this has not been reflected on my credit record/history because of this. 
Last year I found out I had a {$37.00} apparent unpaid medical bill since XXXX which I not only did not know it existed and once I found out ( because It was reflected on my credit report ), I decided to pay it even though I thought It was a fraudulent bill. 
The question to ask these three cold heart credit report institutions is that if they feel {$37.00} is a serious delinquency? 
And worst of all is that these cold heart institutions will keep reporting for seven years this {$37.00} as a serious delinquency even though is has been paid off. 
I believe, a law should be passed to ban these credit report institutions from reporting as serious or even plain delinquencies amounts below {$100.00} or a sum considered irrelevant. I will write today a letter to my district congresswoman to start a campaign against these and other harmful policies and practices and have the US Congress review these credit report institutions to obligated them to have fair and reasonable practices and policies. It seems to me, no government institutions supervise and controls these institutions, if the can be called institutions. 
Nobody is a delinquent for having a {$37.00} record or {$100.00} or {$1000.00} on their report, is not a crime, a delinquent is a person that has transgressed the law, its illegal to call somebody a delinquent for an unpaid bill. This is unacceptable. 
These institutions have to do their home work to establish once received a report specially from collection agencies if the report is fraudulent or not, it seems these institutions only collect information and sell it as is, they have not adopted controls over the information received or at least, get in contact with the affected consumer to check if its a fraudulent record. These institutions could well be just a computer since they do nothing but collect information and sell if, they don't care about the consumers.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

16,04/23/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I have a Amazon Credit card from Synchrony bank and last week I checked my account and I was surprised to see a one time {$990.00} charge from the credit card company on top of the regular interest I have been charged on a monthly basis. I called the bank and was told the first time by the person on the phone that she was going to escalate the issue and have the fees refunded to my account. I was never aware of a promotion that was going to charge me that much interest at the end of 12 months neither did I received a reminder about getting charged that much money on interest due to s promotion who is about to expire. I purchased my products on Amazon and selected my Amazon card at the end of the checkout process, however I wasn't aware of something like that. This is unprofessional and I feel like I have been scammed. I called again today the bank trying to speak to someone and their agents were rude and unwilling to help. I'm filing a complaint here, however if I don't hear back from the bank or Amazon, I will file a lawsuit against the bank for malpractice and overcharging my account. I will not let this go and I'm not agreeing on paying for this ridiculous high interest fee. This is outrageous and unbelievable. Banks can just charge you fees and interest like that without giving you a warning. Who is going to protect us. Why Synchrony bank never send me a email, letter or any communication regarding a promotion I signed off which I was never aware. Why I was never aware of the promotion from the start to the end especially if I was going to be charged a ridiculous amount. When did Synchrony bank send me any notifications regarding this promotion and the charges I was going to get? I will definitely file a lawsuit and use any means necessary to tell my story and get the charges reversed back. 

I have now an additional {$990.00} on my credit card balance and stuck with paying for that.

18,04/26/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"All dates stated here are year XXXX. This is a follow-up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX. After you intervened, Wells Fargo ( WF ) did finally pay me on XX/XX/XXXX the then-remaining credit balance of {$4200.00} on my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I then paid WF {$400.00} to cover a {$400.00} charge I'd made to cover a dental bill I had put on the card on XX/XX/XXXX. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, WF put a FALSE AND FRAUDULENT debit charge on the card of {$4600.00}, which I had NOT incurred and which they labelled a "" payment adjustment '', so that the card appeared to have a "" balance '' ( owing ) of {$4200.00} even though there actually was no balance owing at all. Since then, I have phoned them repeatedly, spoken to multiple Reps and multiple Supervisors on recorded lines. Each and every one of the people I spoke to, on reviewing the account, agreed that I owe WF no money, they owe me no money, and my account balance is XXXX. They have at least twice escalated the issue to Corporate, to the effect that I received a letter from Corporate dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they received my WF complaint # XXXX and I would hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX, and then a follow-up letter ( same case ) dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I "" can expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX ''. Meanwhile, sometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I got a phone call ( male, don't recall name ) who reassured me that WF agreed I have a XXXX balance, and they were working on it, and in the meanwhile until they fixed their records they would not require any minimum payment on this "" phantom '' {$4200.00} because they knew I didn't owe them any money, nor would I have to pay any Interest or any "" didn't make payment '' fees. Then last week on XX/XX/XXXX I logged on to my account, and not only was the {$4200.00} still there, but now it also demanded that I pay a {$42.00} minimum payment. When I then called again ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) the Rep "" XXXX XXXX '' said that [ 1 ] she had seen this exact kind of problem before and would send another Complaint to Corporate, and [ 2 ] if I didn't pay at least {$42.00} on this money I DID NOT OWE then WF would charge me a nonpayment fee, and [ 3 ] if I didn't pay WF the ENTIRE {$4200.00} that I didn't owe then they would charge me Interest on any "" unpaid '' amount. I then spoke to her Supervisor XXXX who told me that though she agreed ( looking at the record ) that I didn't owe WF any money and the {$4200.00} "" balance owing '' they had on my account was in ERROR, she couldn't do anything about it ; XXXX said SHE would also send another Complaint to Corporate, and XXXX told me that she could request for me a temporary "" COVID19 '' waiver of both minimum payments AND any interest charges on any unpaid balance, so that's what I did. I have spent at least 5 hours and probably more like 10 hrs or more both being on Hold and talking to many WF Reps about this {$4200.00} that my Statement has on it but that WF agrees I do not owe, and have gotten NOWHERE.

This month my payment did not come out, and when I called them about it, it was informed that they changed the terms and conditions and cancelled my automatic payments because I did not accept the terms and conditions. This account is paperless and I manage it using their app, so they informed me that the new terms should be on my online statement and it is my fault if I did not find them. Even after being told this and searching for this notification, I still can not find the new terms, or where I need to go to accept them after reading them. 

The problem is that they will not refund the late fee that was accrued because they decided not to take out my payment as agreed upon. The last payment was taken out of my account on XX/XX/2020. Citibank cancelled my automatic payment schedule on XX/XX/2020, without providing notification that they cancelled my scheduled payments. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, so my payment is late because I did not know they were not going to comply with the terms of our agreement.

I had not received one billing statement in the mail between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX notifying me of an outstanding balance or late fees. As my credit card history shows, I paid my credit card monthly and had been in good standing with Barclaycard.

I received a letter from Barclaycard dated XX/XX/XXXX with the case number for the dispute saying they would let me know when they had completed their review.

It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts. 

COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX In addition, it has also been discovered that these STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me. 

STUDENT LOAN CREDITORS : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX Policy states ... 

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

I had no idea I had an outstanding debt and asked for details and why I was not notified earlier since it has been three years. He then explained they may have just taken the debt on for the client. I asked for more information and asked if they could mail me something with a breakdown of what I would pay to resolve the debt he said that something was sent out XX/XX/2020. I told them I never received anything because it was 2 days prior. I also asked if there was information because I was in a car driving since I was working today. I asked him to cut to the point in which he responded to me how would I like to pay the debt with master card or visa. I said I can not pay this because I want to cross check everything on my end and make sure this makes sense. He then got frustrated and said if we want to take your identity we could open a credit card with the information we have. I asked if he could email me the information and he said hold and we got disconnected. I called back at XXXX EST later once I finished everything. Again I did not want to leave anything to chance and needed to find out more information. I spoke to my old roommate and he also said he remembers everything with the apartment being squared away so I was wondering if this was a mistake or did IQ Data International debt collection get information from my old apartment complex. 
When I got through I was transferred twice and put on the phone with the same person that I was talking to that afternoon. He said he got clearance from his operations manager XXXX to send over the information. So I ran inside and could not find the email and he resent and found it. They sent over part of the lease agreement that I signed, when we moved in and moved out, payments made, and MY PERSONAL INFORMATION. Over email they sent a copy of my passport, drivers license and social security card that was not in a secured link! 
So I went through everything they sent me and asked to look into this to see if anything was missing because again to my knowledge for the past three years there as been no problems. So this person had to get a "" senior partner '' to give permission to give a hold. That partner got on the phone and said he will give me 1 hour to pay. I explained I just heard about this today and have not received any other information prior. He said the world is not fair and that is why he got into this so he can help people. I explained I need to look into this to make sure it is legit since I just learned about this today and I have not received anything in the mail. He then said he personally sent something out on XX/XX/2020 and I asked right away why did the other guy say something was sent out on XX/XX/2020. He paused and said that was the second notice and we do not have to send anything in the mail since we are talking to you now. The he went on to say the same thing about if he wanted to open a credit card in my name he has the information to do so. He also said they have wasted enough time on me and they will no longer give me the 1 hour hold. Then he went on to say I can let it affect my credit it and it will stick on my credit and I will pay more. I said okay can I pay online or mail a check. He said no we do not accept those forms of payment we only take visa and master over the phone. I hung up after this because something did not sound right.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

The transaction was authorized by me for the amount of XXXX $ for a watch. 
XXXX order number is XXXX and it was sold by XXXX id XXXX and title of the item is XXXX XXXX Submariner Ceramic Two Tone XXXX XXXX Dial XXXX Men 's Watch. The XXXX   item number is XXXX XXXX date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
I paid using my Attuniversal card via XXXX. I never received my item from the seller. The tracking number they provided shows clearly the item was sent somewhere else and signed for by someone but not to my physical address. I never recieved anything at my address and nor did i sign for anything and believe it is fraud. The seller never responded. 
The seller never responded to numerous emails that I sent via XXXX. It was then i contacted ATTUniversal card. The person who took my call must have misunderstood me and opened a case of fraudulent charge that i did not authorize. But I did authorize the charge but I never recieved the item. 
I even called the next day and spoke to another agent at ATTuniversal and they said that I did a good thing of calling as the case only showed that a fraudulent charge was made. 
The agent stated that he was able to add notes to the current case and that things should resolve soon. Sadly, that is not what happened. I was never contacted about anything in regards to the situation by ATTuniversl citi cards. I simply got a Letter via online that stated against me but was a little confusing. So i called ATTuniversal again and they said nothing to worry, they have agreed in my favor. i was relieved to hear that. But later, i saw the charge was added to my billing in the amount of XXXX . Clearly there has been a mistake. I have already contacted ATTuniversal Citi and also XXXX. They have stated that the case is ongoing but what I do not see that anywhere on my acct on ATTuniversal citi nor XXXX but i was told the case is open and the merchant has been contacted. I must have made about 30 calls to XXXX and attuniversal citi cards regarding this matter. They should have a record of all calls and also recordings. 

If you simply look at the tracking the Seller has provided, you will see that the item never was sent to me. It is a XXXX tracking number of XXXX that the seller provided to XXXX. When i clicked on it, it showed the item was already delivered and signed for on XX/XX/XXXX ... .that is before I even bought the item!. 
The XXXX listing is XX/XX/XXXX but delivery shows XX/XX/XXXX? to XXXX XXXX, XXXX .... I am in XXXX. not in XXXX. Once again, item bought XX/XX/XXXX but delivered XX/XX/XXXX? how can that be? and delivered to XXXX  where the item was supposedly coming from. I am in XXXX  my whole life. 
I have copies of all that i could gather to show proof of the fraud that this seller has done. I even mailed it to the Citi cards via certified mail and also to XXXX but to no avail did I get a response. I am so disappointed about how long this is taking but i believe once the respected merchant see 's this, they will conclude what has taken place. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you asap to close the matter. I have been a faithful citi card customer and XXXX customer for years. thank you for hearing my plea and request.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts. 

COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX XXXX  Policy states ... 

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

104,04/08/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I first notified XXXX XXXX back in XXXX of an account that is reporting on my credit report that is not mines. This is account was fraudulent obtained by a relative of mine who has a similar name as mine. I was told from XXXX XXXX attorney to have a copy of a letter notarized from the relative stating that this was not my account and that I was not responsible for the bill. Once I did that I was told by the attorney to send a copy of the notarized letter to XXXX XXXX and they would delete it off of my credit report. I did that as well and it was never deleted off of my Credit Report. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to call and harass me regarding this account. They called in XXXX and again in XXXX demanding that I pay this. In XXXX I was told from a representative that they would be deleting it from my credit report and that I would not be getting anymore calls. Upon me trying to obtain a house in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that this was still showing up on my Credit Report. I contacted XXXX XXXX by phone in XXXX disputing this account once again. I was told that I owe the money and that I needed to pay it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I then sent in a letter to all 3 Credit Bureaus ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX  ) disputing the accuracy of an account reporting on my credit report that was not mine.I was also disputing the several inaccurate addresses on my report that belongs to the relative who obtain the Credit. I also asked the Credit Bureaus to send me documentation that I signed for this loan as well as the name of the person who they contacted from the Original Lender. On XX/XX/XXXX I received dispute results back from all 3 Credit Bureaus stating that the account was verified as accurate along with the different addresses. I never received any other supporting documentation with it. According to the FCRA if the Credit Bureaus nor the Original Data Furnisher can provide me with supporting information within 30 days of the dispute they must delete the inaccurate information from my credit report. 

How is it possible for all the Credit Bureaus to get accurate information from XXXX XXXX when I truly have proof that this information is inaccurate along with the addresses. That leads me to believe that the Credit Bureaus did not do a thorough investigation nor did XXXX XXXX send them accurate information. I have a notarized letter from the person who got the loan in my name. The notarized letter specifically has his Social Security Number on there along with his full name. On the letter you will see that we have the same first and last name. Same middle initial. However, it is a different Middle name although it is the same INITIAL. 

As I stated before, I have been dealing with this since XXXX. I have given XXXX XXXX, ALL 3 CREDIT BUREAUS ample amount of time to rectify this issue to be removed off of my credit report. If this is not resolved this time you all leave me know choice, but to retain a FCRA Attorney and file several lawsuits. If won I can be awarded up to {$1000.00} per violation and you all have violated several of my rights. 

Please have this inaccurate information along with the addresses DELETED immediately from all 3 of my CREDIT REPORTS. This inaccurate information reporting is apprehending me from securing a Home Loan for me and my family. I await an updated Credit Report along with a letter informing me that you all have notified all 3 Credit Bureaus to remove the inaccurate information from my credit report.

I figured it was a scammer. I did not call the "" nice man ''. They continued to call. I finally answered. I asked what it was about. They said debt collection. I told them that I am not even one month behind on ANY bill, have not been, and they obviously have the wrong person ( There are 2 or 3 people with pretty much the same name as mine in my town ). I told them it is not my debt and stop calling me. Never heard from them again. Now I see that my credit score has inexplicably dropped 100 points, so I check with XXXX.

We complied and submitted to Amerisave all request for meeting, documents and informations. Eventually, at the end of intake, as I reviewed the Loan Estimate and Disclosure, they maid us paid the Appraisal Cost of XXXX XXXX which they said will be returned/creditted back upon closing. 

We received another copy of Disclosure and Loan Estimate on XX/XX/XXXX, same information with the initial Disclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. They also made as signed the rate Lock-In Agreement, which is to protect Applicants for any changes in the market. 

On XX/XX/2020, we received another Disclosure with totally different numbers. The interest rate has gone up to 3.25 %, and so as the loan amount from {$120000.00} to {$120000.00}. Everything gone up. They provided us reasons for the change. One is that the type of property is a condo and, not a townhouse. 

I sent out a letter to Amerisave Loan Originator regarding our concern and request. We hoped to update the loan estimate and, eventually, lower the loan amount, but failed to get a satisfactory response, instead, we were asked to either move on or cancel our application. We decided to cancel. 

We believe and feel, that we have been a victim of Bait and Switch. We could have avoided the cost of Appraisal paid to them, if Amerisave reviewed our applications and disclosure properly. This is unfair to us. After we cancelled, I sent an email to Loan Originator, formally cancelling our application and requested a refund of {$470.00} for the cost of Appraisal.

I went to the bank in the drive-thru lane to make a withdrawal of my funds during this tuff time period. I am told by the banker that i would not be able to make a withdrawal. Immediately I knew that I was being racially profiled. I asked why and the banker said my account has a block. I ask why my account has a block and he did not mention that he was the one who enacted the block but came up with some excuse that I can't remember at this time. He secretly blocked my account without notifying me while i was there. I find that strange because I was using my debit card just fine before I went to that bank to make my withdrawal. The banker refused to withdraw my funds and treated me with such disrespect that I have ever been treated within my life from a banker. I went home and cried because I know that banks would either be reluctant to release my funds to me because of XXXX or the fact that they are racially profiling me. I have called numerous times numerous days IN A ROW! Thankfully I was able to get my money out by sending the money to someone else using XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Otherwise, the bank would still be holding my money captive during this crazy tuff time. US bank dropped the ball this time.

I am so upset and frustrated I have even called corporate and are waiting for a response. Corporate has told me numerous times they would not be able to release the block on my account and only the manager of the bank who racially profiled me could. They told me they would reach out and get back to me and they have not. I want whoever to be held responsible for making my life harder than it already is. Nobody has helped me to solve my problem.

They indicated I do not qualify for their Covid-19 relief program because of late payments. 

I have paid all of my payments on the due date or one day before via ACH on their website for years. It turns out, the don't post payments made via ACH on their website for up to 1 business day and always after the weekend. I had no idea I was racking up late fees while paying on time. I am incensed in frustration to discover they were "" floating my payments '' to my detriment and charging me late fees. 

They are now using that as the disqualifying reason that they will no extend me the payment deferral that every single other creditor ( dozen plus ) has extended to me including tier 1 and tier 2 credit  cards and banks. This is at least an abuse of their treatment of payments to their benefit. It is a worst a slap in the face to me as a business owner in legitimate distress. This is a matter principle. The payment that they would defer is only {$66.00}. And yes, that {$66.00} matters to me this month by never mattered enough in the past to even notice the egregious late fee policy.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report.

He claimed that his colleague XXXX XXXX was working on another customer 's accounts and got some of my information involved. That was absolute XXXX. I immediately requested to speak to the Bank Manager.  When I brought this to the attention of the Bank Manager, his attitude was very disturbing.

So I requested them to immediately close my accounts, They informed me that all pending transactions had to be cleared first, and then they would contact me. After a week had expired and I wasn't contacted, I went into the Branch in person. I requested to meet with the Branch Manager again. I told him that if my accounts weren't immediate closed and I didn't receive my full funds, I was going to file serious fraud charges against him and anyone involved with my accounts.

161,04/18/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I applied for a store credit card at XXXX XXXX and auto in XX/XX/2019 when I purchased a set of tires. The card was issued in the wrong name which caused a delay in getting the first statement. I paid the entire amount due upon receipt of the initial statement which was received by me after the due date but before the billing cycle close date. I have sent several notices to their secure message system with regards to the incorrect name on this account and I have not received any relevant replies regarding action on my request to change the individual name on the account to the name of the individual that filed the credit card application ( myself ) and conducted the lone credit transaction associated with this account. I have also talked with multiple customer service representatives via telephone regarding the erroneous billings, but they state that since my name is not the name of the person on the account, they can not help me, even though I am the person who applied for the credit. I could tell an untruth and say I am the person whose name is on the account, but I refuse to state that I am someone who I am not. 
The error still has not been corrected after six months of repeated attempts. This atrocious service reflects very poorly on XXXX XXXX XXXX in general and Citibank in particular. The name listed on the account is not the name of the person that applied for the credit card account. The error in billing name caused by Citibank and XXXX XXXX  and/or one or more of Citibank 's and XXXX XXXX representatives has caused delays in receipt of statements and notifications sent by Citibank to the account owner since the correspondence is not addressed to the account applicant/owner. In addition, this error and inability or unwillingness for Citibank to correct its and/or Citibanks partners mistakes has caused undue duress, frustration, time, and costs associated with repeated attempts to pursued Citibank to correct Citibank 's mistake. This error caused wholly by Citibank resulted in the accumulation of late fees and interest fees that otherwise would not have resulted had Citibank conducted its activities in a prudent manner. 

Due to the egregious error and blatant disregard to my previous requests to correct the error made by Citibank, under the provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and pursuant to 15 U.S.C 1692g ( a ), I have written to inform Citibank that I dispute the validity of the debt in its entirety. According to my understanding of the provisions of the Fair Debt collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) they must stop any and all contact with me until after my dispute has been investigated and they have provided proof of the debt in writing to me. However, they have continued to send statements indicating amounts due without provided requested proof.

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is nota factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is that they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

While traveling, my wallet, which contained my credit cards, was stolen. I reported the theft to the Macys Store American Express credit card issuer during XX/XX/2020 and my account was locked until a new card was issued to me. My locked account did not allow me to pay my bill that month.

I contacted Macys credit card services via telephone to report the issue and they reported that it was an error on their part - due to the system locking my account - and waived the late fee. With the assistance of the customer representative, I paid the amount immediately over the phone for only the amount due, without the late fee.

220,04/06/20,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Managing an account,Deposits or withdrawals,"This complaint is about Bank of America 's ( BA ) failure to provide access to my funds.

It is the second time in six months that BA has failed to provide access to my funds. In the first instance, BA admitted that it failed to provide immediate access to funds transferred to my account from the Federal Treasury.

This time, BA is not providing access to funds deposited directly with them. 
The date of the most recent occurrence was XX/XX/2020 : The initial time was XXXX XXXX ( I had an appointment ). 

For the last six months, I've had two CDs at BA -- one of six months duration and a renewable nine month CD. 

Subsequent to the maturity date of the two CDs, I went to the local branch to renew the nine month CD ( {$130000.00} ), intending to include in the new nine month CD {$15000.00} in cash from another account at the bank, and the balance in the six month CD ( {$32000.00} ).

The first person who tried to complete the task failed to include the {$15000.00}. Efforts on the part of a more senior employee with help from the back of the BA 's CD Department resulted ( I've been told ) to the addition of the {$15000.00} to the CD account. The total should be {$180.00}, XXXX. Since all of that money was already on deposit with the bank, I should have access to all of it. 

I was informed that it could take as long as a week to correct the Bank 's system, and until that time I would not have access to MY {$15000.00}. 

Really? It was already my money, and it's in the bank. 

Though the performance of the two individuals in the branch was less than stellar. My complaint is that BA 's system doe not provide a way for human employees to correct mistakes made by the bank in a way that provides depositors with immediate access to their funds.

It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 
INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

234,04/20/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"Citibank refuses to remove me as an authorized user on my mother 's credit card. Both my mother and I have spent over 7 hours on the phone with Citi Bank on XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 respectively. We were transferred around endlessly between different departments, each saying they do not have the authority to process the request because my mother is on a repayment program, and I must talk to the department who last transferred us. It doesn't appear anyone at the company is capable of performing this routine function. 

Even though the account was closed nearly 3 years ago, they only started reporting my authorized user status to credit reporting agencies one month ago, which caused my credit score to drop 20 points in 30 days, so it is not a trivial matter. 

My belief is that Citibank wants to keep me as an authorized user and apply credit pressure in case my elderly mother dies or defaults on payments so that they can come after me, despite there being no legal justification for keeping me on the account that they can cite. Not only is the account closed, I haven't even had a physical card for this account or initiated a purchase on it in nearly 10 years.

( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( XXXX ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( XXXX ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account. I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) you have on file of the accounts listed below.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX   XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

She first added me to her XXXX card in XXXX, around XXXX/XXXX, when I first moved to the XXXX. 

We had a slight upset in our marriage around XXXX XXXX and she removed me from her card. Things were fixed and I was added back to the card around XX/XX/XXXX, 8 months ago. 

Since then I have made numerous calls to XXXX XXXX   and the credit agencies to find out why this card is not being reported properly as it doesn't show up on any credit report. I have used my card multiple times so we know that isn't an issue. 
XXXX XXXX  say they're reporting correctly and the credit agencies say there aren't any problems their end. Essentially I'm stuck in the middle and no one will take accountability as to why this credit card isn't showing on my report, choosing to blame the other instead. 

Since being added as an authorized user in XX/XX/XXXX I have obtained various lines of credit that have all been reported fine, one being another credit card and the other being a car lease. There has been no issue reporting either to the credit agencies.

I have received 3 letters from XXXX XXXX  stating they are reporting correctly, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX however this does not seem to the the case. 

Every time I call XXXX XXXX  for an update they confirm my personal information and tell me to wait 30 days. The first few months they had the incorrect SSN for me, they only noticed after several phones calls from myself. The next few months I noticed they weren't using the correct credit card number so I wouldn't ; t have been associated with that account. It seems like there has been numerous errors at XXXX XXXX  and I'm the one suffering.

Today XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX XXXX  following up with my latest enquiry only to find out nothing has been done for 3 weeks. Allegedly they tried to call my wife to confirm SSN, DOB and our names. I have been told to wait another 30 days.

These medical bills and other derogatory collection accounts listed on my credit report, are incorrect and NOT mine. Simply verifying that someone used my name, social security number and/or address is insufficient to confirm that I am the person in question and owe this debt. 
The court has ruled that in Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management , Inc., that during a dispute and subsequent investigation with the original creditor, collector or a credit bureau, that the original creditor or collector, must provide account-level documentation that would hold up when presented to a jury. That means an original contract or similar proof.

As I am not the person who owes this bill, I am aware that providing the information requested may lead to third party disclosure : a HIPAA violation. That would be your problem and not mines, as a consumer. And per the FCRA and FCPA, I am not required to complete a police report since the burden to prove the debt is on you. 
In addition, a provision of the FACTA regulations is the Notice of Negative Information provision, covered in section 623 ( A ) ( 7 ). 
I have never received notification that this had been or was going to be listed with a credit reporting agency. FACTA ( Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ) requires creditors, including doctors and hospitals, to give the consumer a warning notice, so the matter can be addressed before a negative item such as this is reported in error. 
I am also requesting a copy of your in-house procedures that enable you to avoid the problems that lead to improper identification of consumers and the subsequent misreporting to the credit bureaus. 
In lieu of supplying the information Im demanding, you can simply stop all collection activity, including but not limited to removing this item from all credit bureaus to which it has been reported.

286,04/07/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by the fraud or security department at Citi AAdvantage Card about a charge of {$230.00} that was being attempted against my credit card. An automated call asked me to verify the charge or indicate if it was fraudulent. I indicated it was fraudulent. Then I received more two text notifications that the same charge was being attempted against my credit card. Both times, I indicated that the charge was not being made by me, that it was fraudulent. I received an email warning me that the same charge was being attempted against my account. Again, I indicated that I did not authorize the charge. I received a third telephone call about the same charge. At that time, after replying again that I did not make or authorize the charge, I agreed with the Citi agent that the account should be closed and all charges to the account should be rejected. When I returned home, I cut up my existing Citi credit cards. 
Citi then sent me new credit cards with a new account number. Some time later, I received an electronic bill for my account which listed the fraudulent charge against my account, as if I had made the charge - even though the Citi security department had identified the charge as fraudulent and told me it would be stopped. I called the Citi customer service and reported the bogus charge on my account. Their agent apologized and assured me the charge would be removed. It was not removed. Weeks later, the charge was still on my account. I called again and also emailed Citi to tell them to remove the charge that they had already identified as clearly fraudulent. I was told that they would need to open an investigation into the charge. I never understood why that would be necessary. Their own security department had identified the charge as fraudulent. I had told Citi on the date of the attempted fraud that the charge was fraudulent and to close my account. They did so. Yet they continued to attempt to make me pay for the fraudulent charge. Today, I received a notice from the Citi security department telling me that they were closing the investigation, and they had ruled against my claim that the charge was not mine. This is after their own security department determined that the charge was fraudulent and closed my account to stop the fraud. I just got off the phone with yet another in a long line of Citi agents - after I screamed at him about how Citi was committing fraud in attempting to bill me for a charge that their own security people had determined ( multiple times ) was fraudulent. He asked me if I knew two people who apparently used my account number to make the charge. I told him I'd never heard of them before, and I did not authorize them to use my account. I told him I had made this clear to the Citi security department on the day of the attempted charge. This agent said he would make a note to reopen the investigation "" for me. '' Reopen the investigation!!! There should never have been an investigation. I told Citi to refuse the charge the day it occurred. They should be investigating themselves.

Early XX/XX/2020, I applied for a VA refinancing loan from Union Bank. At the onset of the application I was advised not to include the income that I received for hosting an exchange student at my home. 

My VA refinance application ( Union Bank Loan Number XXXX ) has been pending over 90 days without resolution. I have paid my own appraisal fee and pest inspection fee prior to the latest closing disclosure dated XX/XX/2020. 
My cash out has been reduced from {$80000.00} to {$19000.00} with the same monthly payment. Most of the XXXX Veterans ( like myself ) own one home and has lived in XXXX County for a long time ( 39 years ) and subsist on their VA XXXX as their primary income. I ( enjoy ) hosting international students as supplementary income for the unexpected expenses and I have been hosting for 10 years. 

I applied for my loan before the pandemic and I am grateful that financial institutions are in place, making loans and providing general banking needs, however, I do not want people losing their homes to fancy math. I have lived through the US predatory loans era and the market recession of XXXX. 

Every eligible veteran applying for a VA loan should be entitled to the lowest interest rate loans on the market. Ive owned my home for 15 years, never late on my mortgage-yet the loan process has taken more than 90 days to get the loan to the disclosure stage. 

I am praying for the ( VA ) loan process to be streamlined and fairly dispersed, so that individuals like myself can prepare for our families within this pandemic. 


Sincerely XXXX XXXX My questions Is it true, that as the interest rate has been lowered, Union Bank charges a higher interest rate for refinancing VA loans? 
Ive paid for my VA appraisal {$600.00}, pest inspection {$150.00} and re-inspection {$99.00} as I have filed this complaint can they cancel my loan? What protections from retaliation does a borrower have?

304,04/10/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I filed dispute with BofA against XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX for an amount of {$2400.00}. I provided over thirty pages of documentation supporting my dispute. I highlighted instances where XXXX personnel where confronted with lies, which were not denied, or challenged. XXXX agreed to complete the work needed ; however, because they were not trust worthy I expressed my desire for a credit to get the work done elsewhere. At this point, XXXX became disgruntled and cut off communications after accusing me of extortion. I informed BofA of XXXX despicable accusation and they informed me not to contact XXXX from that point on, which I complied. 

BofA claimed they hadnt received the required information by the XX/XX/XXXX deadline and closed the claim, even though the information was faxed to them on XX/XX/XXXX. Once I realized the claim had been closed I called them, they reopened the case and later applied a credit in XX/XX/XXXX. 

BofA once again closed the claim in XXXX of XXXX, claiming that information had not been forwarded ; however I never received any notification for additional information in the form of a letter, email, phone call, or text message. All I received was a notification that the case was closed. This is in stark contrast with the messages I received persistent text messages for an account balance that was under dispute, and rightfully should not be up for collection in XXXX of XXXX. 

I called and they reopened the case, but didnt remove the charge from my account. 
XX/XX/XXXX I forwarded the additional information requested and have yet to receive a response on my claim status after several follow ups with BofA via phone calls. I also requested details of BofAs dispute process : what has happened, what their procedures are to better understand what has happened to determine what actions theyve taken on my behalf to resolve this dispute. They have ignored these requests. 

XX/XX/XXXX, with only the disputed balance on my account, BofA started forwarding collection messages, even though the claim is still pending, and has been open for roughly six months. 

After receiving collections notices, I called my local branch to have them reach out to the disputes department about the collection efforts that I believed should not be happening. Disputes told local rep that the amount would be removed from my account and a letter would be sent notifying me of the credit while the investigation was pending. 

A week or so after receiving no letter, I called the dispute department. They informed me that the charge would not be removed and the dispute would be escalated. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA for a status update, only to hear that they will not do anything to escalate the resolution of the case, and will not remove the charge until the case is complete, even though it was their error why the charge was reapplied to the account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NJ,078XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/10/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3601545,file dispute bofa unknown unknown unknown unknown amount 240000 provide thirty page documentation support dispute highlight instance unknown personnel confront lie deny challenge unknown agree complete work need however trust worthy express desire credit get work do elsewhere point unknown become disgruntle cut communications accuse extortion inform bofa unknown despicable accusation inform contact unknown point comply bofa claim hadnt receive require information unknown deadline close claim even though information fax unknown realize claim close call reopen case later apply credit unknown bofa close claim unknown unknown claim information forward however never receive notification additional information form letter email phone call text message receive notification case close stark contrast message receive persistent text message account balance dispute rightfully collection unknown unknown call reopen case didnt remove charge account unknown forward additional information request yet receive response claim status several follow up bofa via phone call also request detail bofas dispute process happen procedures better understand happen determine action theyve take behalf resolve dispute ignore request unknown dispute balance account bofa start forward collection message even though claim still pending open roughly six months receive collections notice call local branch reach dispute department collection efforts believe happen dispute tell local rep amount would remove account letter would send notify credit investigation pending week receive letter call dispute department inform charge would remove dispute would escalate unknown call bofa status update hear anything escalate resolution case remove charge case complete even though error charge reapplied account,0,0,0

307,04/14/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"In XX/XX/XXXX someone fraudulently used my Citi Bank XXXX XXXX credit card to make purchases at XXXX and XXXX. I have never used these websites, or even heard of XXXX prior to this. From XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, there were approximately XXXX transactions on the card totaling {$33000.00} by my calculations. Citi bank never informed me of these fraudulent charges despite how many there were. It was only after I checked my balance online did I see the charges and notify them. I also immediately notified XXXX. 

I was asked to be patient by Citi and was told it could take two or three billing cycles to resolve the issue. I have not received any communications from Citi or XXXX to keep me informed as to the progress. All that I've been told from Citi was that the investigation is closed and resolved via email. It does appear that there are credits on the account of {$38000.00}. I have no idea why that amount does not coincide with the {$33000.00} in fraudulent charges. 

My issue now is that I still have a balance on the card in excess of {$14000.00} and the XX/XX/XXXX statement shows approximately {$18000.00} in new charges from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX that have post dates of XXXX and XXXX. These are duplicate charges that now appear as a balance. I was told by a representative in the Citi fraud dept on XX/XX/XXXX that those are rebilled as there are duplicate credits on the account from Citi and XXXX that need to be rectified. As you can see, this is extremely confusing and the card statements are impossible to follow and add the transactions correctly. I am not a forensic accountant! I have gotten no help from Citi either. I attempted to contact customer service last week and was on hold for over two hours before I finally hung up. I understand that staffing is down with the current Covid19 situation, but frankly, that is not by problem and this situation should have been resolved before now anyway. 

I have been patient for over three months and still have a balance on my card over {$14000.00} that is incorrect. My credit score has been affected and this is all through no fault of my own.

309,04/20/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Due to Covid-19 I wanted to explore my repayment options on the mortgage. My loan is serviced by SunTrust, which is now Truist. 

I first spoke with a representative from Suntrust by the name of XXXX XXXX. He explained that no deferment was available, and by direction from XXXX XXXX ( The owner of the loan ) they have only been advised to offer a Forbearance. I did not see the benefits of the forbearance program, except for as a fail safe. XXXX explained that I could enroll into the forbearance program and keep my bi-weekly recurring auto ebit schedule. SunTrust would continue to debit me automatically on my same schedule, but if I could not make a payment at any time, I would "" fall back '' onto the forbearance. The ability to keep my biweekly recurring auto payment was the ONLY reason I agreed to the program. SunTrust makes you jump through hoops to enroll into bi-weekly debits, which ultimately save a customer money in interest the long run. You have fill out a form, wait a month, and pay your mortgage up a month. Before my refinance my loan was serviced through XXXX XXXX, and I could set up bi-weekly debits within minutes on their website. I think SunTrusts practices on setting up bi-weekly debits is borderline unfair and deceptive. It should be simple for a consumer to set up their mortgage in a way that's beneficial for them to save money on interest. 

Seven to 10 days later, I also spoke with a representative from Home Preservation - the department that handles the Forbearance process for SunTrust. She also advised me that I did not have to stop my bi-weekly recurring auto debit. She also went a step further and said that if I did, I would have to go through the process of re-enrolling, which I just explained is not consumer friendly. I confirmed with her multiple times that I did not want to do this. My home preservation specialist name is XXXX XXXX. The representative stated that I could enroll into Forbearance and keep my auto payments, just like XXXX did above. 

My bi-weekly payment was scheduled to debit on XX/XX/XXXX and it did not come out. Later the next week I received a letter from SunTrust stating that I was enrolled into the Forbearance program, and my recurring auto debit had ceased. I spent the entire week of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX unsuccessfully trying to get hold of XXXX XXXX or anyone at SunTrust and Home Preservation - including waiting on hold 2+ hours several times and sending multiple emails. SunTrust 's IVR phone system states that I could leave a call back number and receive a call back within 24 hours, which I have not received. 

When I finally got through to someone on XX/XX/XXXX, I was advised that I was misinformed. I requested my situation to be escalated for a solution. I want things to go back to normal, even if I have to withdraw from forbearance. Enrolling into forbearance was me being proactive, and looking at the worst case scenario due to the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19. All the while I have the funds to pay, and want to pay on my bi weekly auto recurring schedule. 

Interesting to note that the entire enrollment into the Forbearance program is done verbally. There is no e-sig or signature required to sign that clearly outlines the program and contract. If there was, and it was delineated that auto-payments would stop, I would not have enrolled. 

I spoke to two representatives who advised me supervisors were unavailable. Neither person was able to clearly articulate a path back to normalcy and guarantee no adverse effects on my account or credit. Also, they stated I would have to go through the SunTrust run around to re-enroll into bi-weekly auto recurring debits, which again is a hassle. Matter of fact, it took me several months to enroll into this program the first time after my refinance from XXXX XXXX, simply because you have to jump through so many hoops! That cost me money in interest, and I think those practices are not consumer friendly and I would guess it's intentional process decision made to boost interest revenue for the company.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Truist Financial Corporation,KS,662XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3614877,due covid19 want explore repayment options mortgage loan service suntrust truist first speak representative suntrust name unknown explain deferment available direction unknown owner loan advise offer forbearance see benefit forbearance program except fail safe unknown explain could enroll forbearance program keep biweekly recur auto ebit schedule suntrust would continue debit automatically schedule could make payment time would fall back onto forbearance ability keep biweekly recur auto payment reason agree program suntrust make jump hoop enroll biweekly debit ultimately save customer money interest long run fill form wait month pay mortgage month refinance loan service unknown could set biweekly debit within minutes website think suntrusts practice set biweekly debit borderline unfair deceptive simple consumer set mortgage way thats beneficial save money interest seven 10 days later also speak representative home preservation department handle forbearance process suntrust also advise stop biweekly recur auto debit also go step say would go process reenrolling explain consumer friendly confirm multiple time want home preservation specialist name unknown representative state could enroll forbearance keep auto payments like unknown biweekly payment schedule debit unknown come later next week receive letter suntrust state enrol forbearance program recur auto debit cease spend entire week unknown unknown unsuccessfully try get hold unknown anyone suntrust home preservation include wait hold 2+ hours several time send multiple email suntrust ivr phone system state could leave call back number receive call back within 24 hours receive finally get someone unknown advise misinform request situation escalate solution want things go back normal even withdraw forbearance enrol forbearance proactive look worst case scenario due uncertainty surround covid19 fund pay want pay bi weekly auto recur schedule interest note entire enrollment forbearance program do verbally esig signature require sign clearly outline program contract delineate autopayments would stop would enrol speak two representatives advise supervisors unavailable neither person able clearly articulate path back normalcy guarantee adverse effect account credit also state would go suntrust run around reenroll biweekly auto recur debit hassle matter fact take several months enroll program first time refinance unknown simply jump many hoop cost money interest think practice consumer friendly would guess intentional process decision make boost interest revenue company,1,1,1

311,04/12/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"On XX/XX/2020 I called Citibank requesting that my accounts be closed and a check mailed to me. I had a checking account and a savings account ; the checking account had {$500.00} and the savings account had {$9900.00}, for a total of {$10000.00}. Agent "" XXXX '' told me that he would close the accounts and have a check mailed to me. He also told me that he would be blocking my debit card and online access so I would need to call for further assistance. 
When I had not yet received the check by XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was told that the check had been mailed on XX/XX/XXXX and to please wait until XX/XX/XXXX. 
After not receiving the check by XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank again and was told that an investigation had been submitted and that I would have a check within 5-7 business days. When I had not received the check by XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank yet again ; the agent I spoke with that time prioritized my call and brought in a supervisor named "" XXXX. '' I was told that the stop & reissue was done on the XX/XX/XXXX ( or XX/XX/XXXX ) and was told to wait one more day until XX/XX/XXXX, to call back if I hadn't received the check, and to ask that my call be prioritized to a supervisor and that they would request that the check be overnighted to me. 
After not receiving the check on XX/XX/XXXX, I called yet again, asked to have my call prioritized to a supervisor, and when I spoke with the supervisor and explained the situation I requested that the check be reissued and sent by overnight delivery. The supervisor I spoke with told me that he could request the check be sent by XXXX-XXXX but that the request might not be granted, and that it could take 7-10 business days to receive the check. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank again ( 6th time, and 5th time since my original call ) to check on the status of the check and request a tracking number. Again I asked to have my call escalated to a supervisor, and this time I spoke with XXXX. XXXX said that the check was reissued on XX/XX/XXXX and generated on XX/XX/XXXX. He said that there was no tracking number. He said he would follow up to see where were at, confirm that the check was mailed to my address, and would call me back on Saturday ( today, XX/XX/XXXX ). It is now almost XXXX on Saturday and I have not received a return phone call from XXXX. 
Today is XX/XX/2020 47 days since I first requested that my account be closed, and I have not yet received my funds. I regret that it has come to having to file a complaint, but I am making no progress trying to deal with Citibank directly. Each time I speak with them it is the exact same promise over and over. It makes no sense to continue trying to dealing with Citibank directly when there has been no progress, and no flexibility or creativity on the part of Citibank to offer alternative solutions. I feel Ive been extremely patient with Citibank. Now Im out of options.

313,04/01/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am still having difficulty dealing with and securing information from Windham Professionals located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA XXXX regarding a XXXX  credit card charge off. I have called Windham on several occasions to request information I am entitled to under both federal and state law with no success. This is my second complaint because the last answer received from Windham did not address my main concern in my first complaint : VERIFY THE DEBT AND PROVIDE AN ACCURATE BREAKDOWN OF THE AMOUNT THEY ARE SEEKING! They simply stated that hey have provided verifications they received from the debtor. I have received the following in the mail from Windham in my plethora of attempts to understand the amount they are seeking : 1. A billing statement from XX/XX/2019 2. A billing statement from XXXX of 2019 3. A billing statement from XX/XX/2019 These three random statements do not provide a breakdown of fees, interest, and principal balance ( or any other fees ). Windham has also NOT provided the credit card agreement, any documents that bear my signature, and other assistance I have requested. There is no way possible for me, the consumer, to breakdown the figure of {$3200.00} to determine the validity of the amount. 

I am requesting, once again, a complete and accurate breakdown of this amount. It is clearly apparent that Windham and their associates do not have this information in their possession. I am the individual consumer and I am at a huge disadvantage to solve this problem.

I am a XXXX year old single woman who lost my job due to Covid19. The amount of the bill for the electrical work was {$10000.00}. I told the company that I didn't have that kind of money and they offered to get me financing. They called GreenSky to get approval for a credit loan. I was given a line of credit exceeding the amount needed. The work took place the week of XX/XX/XXXX but was and is not completed, and the fixed payments to GreenSky are to start @ 40 days thereafter. On XXXX I was notified via email, that there was activity on my account. GreenSky paid the electrical company, Mr.XXXX, the full amount. The contracted work has not been completed. I then called GreenSky and asked them if I was their client, of course was their answer. I then told them that any credit card company calls their client when there is a large charge that is not usual and asks for authorization for the charge. I asked them why I wasn't notified? I asked them if they were aware that the job was not completed? I asked them if they pay for services in full when a job has not been completed? I told them that they left me holding the bag in essence because Mr. XXXX is not responding to me regarding finishing the job and that now, why should they when GreenSky has now paid them in full. From their actions, it appears to me that they were doing what was best for Mr. XXXX, and not me, their client. It makes me question just who their client really is? I got no response and when I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told to take it up with Mr. XXXX. As I mentioned in the beginning, I am out of work because of Covid19 and now I have been notified by the Credit Bureau Agencies, that my credit has dropped over 30 points because of this. I called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and was told that of course I could lodge a Complaint but that it doesn't necessarily mean that action would be taken.

For two consecutive months ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) extra fees have been posted to my loan payment statement for information sought by those potential lenders in regard to the "" payoff amount. '' These fees are nowhere spelled out anywhere in my VA IRRRL documents ( completed in XX/XX/2014 ) as necessary to having the loan paid completely. A careful bit of analysis would seem to indicate this is a form of "" ballooning '' the amount of the loan to the benefit of the servicing entity, here, M & T Bank. If they are allowed to continue to do this to all Veterans for whom they provide "" loan servicing, '' this will amount to hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of dollars taken from Veterans who are on a single income - their VA compensation. I, personally, am not in fear of foreclosure as I have stopped the entire process of seeking a new VA IRRRL as the process had become far more complicated than I was initially told when contacted by these lenders ( there were 3 ). These "" fees '' are not huge in terms of my loan, but I question by what authority does M & T Bank believe it has the right to raise the cost of my mortgage to me except through legally required notifications of a prospective change to the loan amount, i.e., I have an escrow account ; therefore, an increase in either or both property taxes and home owner 's insurance would be something which the servicing entity is required to inform me.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without m
y knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX   XXXX/XXXX  I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these  accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

371,03/31/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts an
d made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... ( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Req
uired ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX/XXXX  |XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

377,04/03/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I have a mortgage with Suntrust. I lost my job, and I can not reach Suntrust to request mortgage forbearance under the CARES Act. I believe that Suntrust may be avoiding and evading its obligations under the CARES Act to grant mortgage forbearance to borrowers by deliberately making it impossible to contact the bank. 

Suntrust has : 1 ) hidden all guidance about mortgage forbearance on its website so that it is impossible to navigate to within its website ( I had to find it through an external search engine ) ; 2 ) failed to post on its website ANY accurate information about borrower rights under the CARES Act ; 3 ) required mortgage customers to speak to a phone representative to request forbearance, and 4 )  understaffed or non-staffed its mortgage customer service phone line so that it is impossible to speak to a representative to request forbearance. 

Yesterday, XX/XX/2020, I waited on hold on Suntrusts customer service line for two hours and 28 minutes, at which time the line simply went dead. No one answered, and I did not hang up Suntrusts system just ended the call. After two hours and 28 minutes on hold. 

Feeling desperate, I tried the line again tonight, XX/XX/2020, when Suntrust *says* it staffs the line until XXXX XXXX. It is now XXXX XXXX and I have been waiting tonight for one hour and 15 minutes, with no end in sight. 

So here is my question : who is checking to make sure that Suntrust is making reasonable efforts, or indeed any efforts, to enable borrowers to request forbearance on their mortgages?

401,04/18/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report.

The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 
Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts. 

COLLECTION AGENCY : No Name on Report ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX COLLECTION AGENCY : XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX In addition, it has also been discovered that these XXXX LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these XXXX  Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education  or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ... 
( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

414,04/03/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"At the beginning of this year we decided to refinance our home. A combination of our credit scores and income documentation, lead to us finding Recovco Mortgage Management , LLC dba XXXX XXXX. Having been a mortgage banker for over 8 years, I did my due diligence with these folks upfront. We sent them over 150 pages of banking statements to be reviewed in detail and ensure that we were qualified financially before starting the loan process. 

It took us 8 weeks to navigate the loan qualification process and then another 2 weeks for the closing. The end result is a deed of trust was recorded on our home and we were never given a loan. We reached out to them and the XXXX XXXX the day after the deed was recorded, only to learn that they had no intention of funding it and had begun the process of attempting to rescind the deed of trust. XXXX  made the decision to halt funding and attempt to rescind my loan without letting us know. The collusion between the two companies is self-evident and is the reason neither made any effort to update us on Monday or Tuesday morning. There was a conscious decision made to withhold that information and an attempt to rescind the documentation without communicating any of it to us. 

After a week of silence, we received an email from XXXX telling us that they sent XXXX XXXX a "" satisfaction '' for the deed of trust. There has been no satisfaction to this loan, because there was never a loan itself. There was a misfiled deed of trust that remained on our home for over a week. There was no communication from XXXX during that timeframe and we still never received anything in writing as to what happened. We qualified and closed on a loan, that they chose to back out of at the 13th hour and then colluded with XXXX XXXX, their normal title company, to rescind the deed of trust without telling us. Not only did we supply this company with our 100 's of pages of personal documents, we also paid for an appraisal that meant nothing because they couldn't off a product to justify it with. The result of this, is that in our current climate we are left in financial ruin, with no answers and two corporations that walked all over us. Both companies treated us poorly throughout the process and especially when it was time to fulfill their side of the qualified transaction. 

The NC Bar Association has reviewed this information along with a 16 page timeline of the events and full communication that occurred. They have decided to launch an investigation that is ongoing at this time. Both a litigation and real estate attorney have also reviewed the information and stated that there is a valid claim. It was noted that there was a breach in XXXX XXXX 's duties to us as a client when refusing to disburse the funds, as well as a breach in the loan commitment from XXXX XXXX. They have identified NC Statutes 45A-4 & 45A-7 and the Good Funds Settlement Act as just a few of the items that were all violated during this transaction.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Recovco Mortgage Management, LLC",NC,284XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/03/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3591612,begin year decide refinance home combination credit score income documentation lead us find recovco mortgage management llc dba unknown mortgage banker 8 years due diligence folks upfront send 150 page bank statements review detail ensure qualify financially start loan process take us 8 weeks navigate loan qualification process another 2 weeks close end result deed trust record home never give loan reach unknown day deed record learn intention fund begin process attempt rescind deed trust unknown make decision halt fund attempt rescind loan without let us know collusion two company selfevident reason neither make effort update us monday tuesday morning conscious decision make withhold information attempt rescind documentation without communicate us week silence receive email unknown tell us send unknown satisfaction deed trust satisfaction loan never loan misfiled deed trust remain home week communication unknown timeframe still never receive anything write happen qualify close loan choose back 13th hour collude unknown normal title company rescind deed trust without tell us supply company 100 page personal document also pay appraisal mean nothing couldnt product justify result current climate leave financial ruin answer two corporations walk us company treat us poorly throughout process especially time fulfill side qualify transaction nc bar association review information along 16 page timeline events full communication occur decide launch investigation ongoing time litigation real estate attorney also review information state valid claim note breach unknown duties us client refuse disburse fund well breach loan commitment unknown identify nc statutes 45a4 45a7 good fund settlement act items violate transaction,1,1,1

421,04/08/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,"On Friday XX/XX/2020 My checking account had a positive balance of about XXXX or more. Then when I checked it at XXXX Saturday it showed negative $ XXXX Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I made a XXXX XXXX deposit and on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX Deposits in cash that were readily available that day for XXXX, and XXXX and at the beginning of Monday when the bank opened XX/XX/XXXX My account was in good standing. Regions did not pay these items so why is it they can charge me XXXX for 3 items when no money ever left my account. They say the items were returned.Returned? The bank had to do nothing. The bank did not send or handle any payments. They simply put those items in red and attached a XXXX XXXX fee to all 3. 

They reorded the transactions and took the highest one being XXXX from my balance of XXXX XXXX or XXXX something and that started the overdraft, then they went and add the smaller ones to add 2 more fees bringing to XXXX. 

If they would have used my balance to cover the 2 small items then i would have only 1 overdraft fee,. But greed seems to be the focus and 1 overdraft was not good enough they wanted all 3 so they took the largest debit first. 

I called and spoke to the rudest supervisor ( the calls are recorded ) I explained to her that I am on a stay home order and have not been able to make my usual XXXX while im down to 2 days a week. My expenses for XXXX left me with XXXX after they were paid and my rent was now due for XXXX. So that left me with XXXX til I got more work, Luckily I was able to email my customers and they prepaid me for future work so I could pay my bils and have some extra to live on til I can get back to work full time. This is an order from the president and I have no choice. But the Supervisor did not care. {$100.00} will feed me3 and put gas in the car to get to any work that may come in. 
This is what regions does and if you look on the FTCs website Regions has a 1 stqar rating but they don't care because they have billions in our money they take for NSF and overdraft fees. They are preditory in that they know who to take money from and they know they will get away with it. I want my money back.I need that money to live on. We may be on a stay at home order for a while and i will most likely have more NSF because of it. I did manage to get my pmts deferred for my auto loan and credit cards but regions wont let go of a chance to collect those profit NSF fees. This bank is a 1 star bank. and its because they treat the people who made them what they are like a piece of dirt,. They enjoy taking these fees and they laugh at us when we make thees complaints because they know they will win in the end.

I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

I spent over $ XXXX - this includes about $ XXXX in spending and $ XXXX in credits, since there were a couple incorrect large charges from vendors that had to be credited, but everything spent and credited on the account happened within the first 120 days. First statement after spending there was no bonus ( within the 120 days ), so I called up and the XXXX XXXX said sometimes it takes an extra statement, but he saw I spent the $ XXXX and would get it by then. Next statement closes, still no bonus. I email them, XXXX XXXX  who responds said it's because of the credit. I call up as I know I still spent the full $ XXXX even with credits, first XXXX XXXX repeats what the letter said, but then added all charges up himself and agrees I am correct and should have gotten the bonus. He speaks with a supervisor who says I'll get it within 7 days. A week later, I get a letter in the mail again stating that I did not spend the $ XXXX and thus am not eligible. I call up and the supervisor I ask to speak with first also says I did not spend the $ XXXX, but then does calculations and says I did, but he says he has no power to do anything except submit another request to a department that handles this, and they will send me a letter.I called up today ( XX/XX/20 ) and the supervisor now finally says that the reason I did not get it is because a charge was reversed but then put on an authorized user card instead of my main card. I called up multiple times when it was within the first 120 days and the customer service rep said everything was fine, I spent the {$10000.00}, and I would get the XXXX.

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 
The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 
I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 
I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

446,04/16/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"Hello, I recently signed up for a new Citi Premier card ( ending in XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. The information packet I received with the card indicated I was not eligible for the sign up bonus of XXXX points after spending {$4000.00} in 3 months because I either "" earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a Citi Rewards+, XXXX XXXX  Preferred, Premier, or Prestige in the past 24 months '' However, I keep very diligent records and see that the last XXXX  card I earned a signup bonus was a previous XXXX XXXX card which I opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending XXXX ), for which I received the bonus points in XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached XXXX  points history, and note that the name listed is XXXX XXXX because that is my maiden name ), which would mean the 24 months has since passed between then and my newest application. 

Of note, I have converted products from that Premier card ( which ended XXXX ) to a Preferred in XX/XX/XXXX, and then to a Rewards+ recently in XX/XX/XXXX, but I never closed any of those XXXX   cards. 

As such, I have neither earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a XXXX  product within the last 24 months and should be eligible for the bonus on this new XXXX  Premier card. 

When I called Citi to explain this issue, it came to my attention that the representative saw an apparent previous Citi Premier card opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending in XXXX ). This is a Citi Premier card opened by my HUSBAND, not by me. I believe that during my application for my Premier card ( ending XXXX ) that I accidentally put in my husband 's SSN rather than my own, and I had to call the application department to correct the application. However, it appears that this original mistake is what caused my new account to be flagged as ineligible for the sign up bonus, due to the original SSN linked to the application to be associated with a recently opened XXXX product. I assumed this would be a simple mistake to correct, and was told the situation would be explained to the "" back office '' and that I would receive a letter resolving the issue. However, I have since received a letter stating that I am still ineligible because I was requesting a "" new account offer [ be ] applied to [ my ] existing account, '' and that new offers are only available on new accounts. 

This completely misses the point that the original offer should have been applied to the new account but was erroneously not-applied due to a mistake on Citi 's part. I am not trying to apply a new-card bonus to an existing card ; I am trying to have a wrongfully refused new-card bonus properly credited to a new-card.

451,04/19/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"1. On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I visited Citibank Magnificent Mile Branch ( Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX ) A banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NMLS XXXX, phone : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, email : XXXX ), helped me open the Citi Bank Account Package account, including new checking and saving accounts, with the promotional XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX bonus miles offer. I also received the email from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that I have successfully got enrolled in this offer. Please see the attached figure for the offer details. 

2. To get the offered bonus of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles, the banker asked me to complete two required activities : ( 1 ) deposit at least {$1000.00} into checking account and at least {$14000.00} into saving account by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 ) maintain the balance in the account for 60 consecutive calendar days following the date when the deposit was made. Then, the bonus will be deposited to my XXXX account within 90 calendar days from the date when I complete the above required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed. 

3. Therefore, following the bank 's guidance : ( 1 ) on XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited {$2000.00} new money to my new checking account and {$14000.00} new money into my savings account. ( 2 ) The total balance of {$16.00}, 000 was maintained in my accounts from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, which is way over 60 days. As a result, I completed the required qualifying activities to be eligible for the offered bonus and should receive the bonus by XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. However, I did not receive the bonus by then. So I contacted the Citi Bank by phone twice in XX/XX/XXXX and the representative told me they would reward me the bonus miles by the middle of XX/XX/XXXX. But, the bonus did not come XX/XX/XXXX. 

5. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the CitiBank at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX ) and the banker told me I am eligible for the bonus and requested an investigation for me. The reference number of investigation XXXX. But, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received the investigation results in my online Citi account, saying that "" Unfortunately, your account does not qualify for this promotion because the required depositwas not maintained for the stated timeframe. '' 6. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the CitiBank at XXXX again. Another banker who talked to us confirmed that I ameligible for the bonus and made another investigation request ( Reference number : XXXX ). She also got my XXXX XXXX account number to be deposited. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the result was exactly the same as that XXXX. 

7. I definitely can not accept the results from Citibank and do believe should get the XXXX bonus miles, because : ( 1 ) I completely followed the guidance from the banker who opened new accounts for me and got me enrolled in this offer and completed all the required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed. 
( 2 ) The offer enrollment confirmation email I received was saying that "" Make a deposit of {$15000.00} or more ( multiple deposits allowed ) in New-to-Citibank funds into 1 ) the new Eligible Checking Account and/or 2 ) the new Eligible Savings Account ''.

452,04/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted 2 disputes, relative to a reservation and stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, to my credit card company, Citibank. The original reservation was lost by the vendor and we were given horribly substandard accommodations which were significantly worse than what had been advertised. This was despite being assured multiple times by the hotel that the accommodations would be comparable, once they determined that they had mistakenly reserved us for one year later. We were not allowed to view the accommodations, until the time of check-in, which was at closing time for management. We immediately presented proof to the hotel reception staff that the accommodations we were given were far inferior to what had been advertised at the time of reservation. We were not given an opportunity to discuss this with management, despite multiple efforts and multiple assurances from the reception staff, that we would be given an opportunity and a monetary adjustment would be made. At checkout, the hotel would not give us an invoice to see the charges, and again denied us the opportunity to speak with management. They made multiple assurances throughout out stay that management would contact us immediately to discuss this. 

At the time of submission of a request for chargeback to Citibank, according to their instructions, and in good faith, I provided a detailed letter of what had occurred and my failed attempts to speak with the management. I provided a prodigious amount of photo documentation and descriptions, including square footage, showing what had been advertised and reserved through XXXX, and what was actually provided. 
The dispute was divided into 2 separate charges, since I initially paid XXXX XXXX a portion of the total at the time of reservation in XX/XX/XXXX. The second charge was made to my Citibank Credit Card, without any further authorization, at the time of checkout, XX/XX/XXXX. The hotel refused to give me an invoice or allow me to speak with management at the time of checkout. As I was instructed, I submitted both disputes via email to dispute department at Citibank, XXXX  

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank sent an electronic message and posted a reply for the second charge. It was dated 3 days after the message itself was dated. Two messages were posted for the same chargeback. The second dispute was missing. I contacted the dispute department and was told that I should immediately sign and send back the response form, in order to have the dispute continued further. I pointed out that only one dispute number was posted, and they assured me that they were not aware of this and would post the second dispute within 48 hours. I received the second response over a week later. In responses, the vendor simply provided a signed key receipt as proof that I had agreed to pay for the rooms provided. I had not agreed to anything except that I would be given a comparable suite and on that basis, I signed for the key. I was given the key receipt prior to being able to see the substandard room. No monetary amount was noted or agreed to on the Hotel 's documentation. No signed invoice was provided, because I was never given one. In the hotels response, they alleged that I had discussed this with them when I had not. 

When I called Citibank, I was told that I should send any additional information that would prove that the accommodations provided were not the ones for which I had agreed to pay. I explained that I had already submitted these, but would be happy to resubmit them. They responded that I did not need to resubmit the information I had already submitted. I was told that the charges would continue to be reversed until further information and the signed responses were received and a resolution was done. On XX/XX/XXXX, on Citibanks secured server, I submitted signed response letters for each of the disputes with detailed letters rebutting the vendors allegations. In the letter, I referred to the previously submitted documentation and offered to re-send it if necessary. It appeared that none of my copious documentation had been reviewed by Citibank Disputes Department and that Citibank was willing to believe the extremely scant documentation provided by the hotel. 

On XXXX, when preparing to pay my bill, I noted that the charges still appeared on my statement. I had received only emails stating that they had received my additional information and would be contacting me soon. I made multiple calls to Citibank over several hours and was disconnected after a recorded statement that was made that all agents were busy. I checked the website messages and no further messages appeared regarding the status of either of these disputes. I finally got through, explained the situation to the agent, and she said that someone from disputes would contact me within 48 hours on my cellphone to update me further. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email alert that a letter was available in messages on the website. I found two letters, once again referring to the same dispute, but not referring to the other dispute. It stated that since I had not provided any information proving that the services rendered were not the ones delivered, that the dispute was considered resolved and the chargeback was reversed. I have spent hours trying to re-contact Citibank to get some explanation of this decision and to find out if they had indeed reviewed all of the documentation I submitted. I have been repeatedly disconnected. 

If the credit card company resolves a dispute, I should be able to understand the basis on which they did so. I should able to confirm that they received and have thoroughly reviewed the documentation that I submitted. I understand that the CoVid19 crisis makes it difficult to contact the company, however this should not be an excuse for their making a decision, clearly without having reviewed my evidence or not clearly explaining their reasons for making the decision despite copious evidence on my part and invalid evidence on the part of the vendor. 


Please note that the attachments I have provided, are identical for both disputes, numbers : XXXX and XXXX. Therefore, rather than duplicate, I will send only one set. The first XXXX photos depict the original listing 900 square foot 1 bedroom villa, which was the basis for my making the reservation and deposit. Photos 1-12 show the room which was given to us, which was less than 1/2 the size of what we contracted for ; very dark, unventilated due to the lack of privacy and need to keep the bedroom windows closed, and very loud due to the location next to a common walkway and with the front door across from the bed, at the top of a common stairway.

453,04/02/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/XXXX ( before my payment due date ) I called in to CitiBank to see if they had any available programs in reference to Coronavirus or COVID19. I was transferred around until I landed on an agent that supposedly could help. I explicitly stated that I could pay my regular bill at the time. I was simply calling in to see if they had any deferment programs so that i could save my cash to use for groceries and such. The agent said she understood and offered to defer my payments and cancel my autopay on both of my accounts. I gladly accepted. 

A few days later I received an email that I had missed a payment. I checked my app and was shown that both of my accounts were labelled as past due, with a late fee attached. I called in immediately to rectify the situation. The first agent I spoke with said that there was no program in place, that they had only received communication of possible programs upcoming, and so the previous representative had spoken in error. I requested a supervisor. Again was told that the initial representative was wrong and there was nothing they could do about it. At this point, I was unworried about the deferred payment but the late fee and the impact on my credit score for having 2 accounts showing a missed payment. I have no missed payments on my credit history. I was told by the supervisor that I shouldn't worry about it, a lot of people are going through things right now and they're sure it will all be handled, just give it time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the late fee on my Citi DoubleCash card was refunded. I noted on XX/XX/XXXX that the late fee was still showing on my Citi American Airline AAdvantage card. I called in at XXXX and after explaining the situation to the initial rep, was transferred to a supervisor. He told me that they would not remove the late fee and there was nothing he could do about it. I explained again, in detail, the situation that led to the late fee in the first place : That I had the funds to make the payments but was erroneously advised by a representative of CitiBank that my payments were deferred and so was under the false understanding that I did not have to make the payment. He still refused to remove the late fee. 

At this time I am requesting the removal of the late fee and the assurance that the ( 2 ) missed  payments will not show on my credit report as the late payment was due to professional negligence and false information provided by a Citi representative/employee, with me, as the consumer, relying on their expertise to guide my payment decision.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",SC,294XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/02/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3590025,unknown payment due date call citibank see available program reference coronavirus covid19 transfer around land agent supposedly could help explicitly state could pay regular bill time simply call see deferment program could save cash use groceries agent say understand offer defer payments cancel autopay account gladly accept days later receive email miss payment check app show account label past due late fee attach call immediately rectify situation first agent speak say program place receive communication possible program upcoming previous representative speak error request supervisor tell initial representative wrong nothing could point unworried defer payment late fee impact credit score 2 account show miss payment miss payments credit history tell supervisor shouldnt worry lot people go things right theyre sure handle give time unknown late fee citi doublecash card refund note unknown late fee still show citi american airline aadvantage card call unknown explain situation initial rep transfer supervisor tell would remove late fee nothing could explain detail situation lead late fee first place fund make payments erroneously advise representative citibank payments defer false understand make payment still refuse remove late fee time request removal late fee assurance 2 miss payments show credit report late payment due professional negligence false information provide citi representative employee consumer rely expertise guide payment decision,0,0,0

Background : Prior to XXXX XXXX - Contacted by fraudster claiming to be XXXX XXXX. They left a message, I did not return the phone call and contacted XXXX, they confirmed it was fraud, I took no further action. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I received a letter from XXXX XXXX  notifying me that a CC application had been submitted with my name and SSN. This was fraud. I contacted XXXX XXXX and they cancelled the request and suggested I call Experian and have a Fraud Alert placed on my credit report. I did as instructed. 
The Problem - There is not a person I was able to speak to at Experian. The automated system is unwieldy, confusing and unhelpful. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to put a Fraud Alert on my credit report. Instead the automated system put a Freeze on my Credit. I do not want a Freeze on my credit. The automated system gave me pin number very rapidly and the signal broke up. I was unable to write down that number or even hear most of it. I was unable to get the automated system to repeat the number. Now my credit is frozen and I have no way to unfreeze it. 
The Damage - I am not longer a citizen with the right to finance a car, home, education, or short term loan for emergencies or entrepreneurial opportunity. The damage that I have experienced is significant and I see no way to rectify this for the rest of my life if I can not speak to a person at Experian.

466,03/31/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Last year, in order my XXXX  office provided XXXX XXXX to provide payments for my wife 's XXXX. We were approved, I thought the payments were made through the XXXX  office, and were unaware that they were made to XXXX XXXX  directly. 
So ... even though my credit score at the time of my house closing in XX/XX/XXXX was XXXX ... .and even though I have been approved for a car loan, dump truck loan, office purchase loan of XXXX, and a track hoe loan through lending institutions, and even though my payments to XXXX XXXX on my XXXX credit limit card have always been made 20 days or more in advance ... .and even though all of my bank payments have been on time, auto draft ... ..and even though all my building accounts are current ... .you XXXX XXXX were able to drop my score 93 points for missing a payment I did not even know existed. I hope you rot and die  in XXXX and I hope I am the one to send you there, and I will work diligently to put you out of business XXXX XXXX  and anyone who supports you. I will work to get your business removed from XXXX XXXX ... no matter how many rounds of golf and drinks you have together. 
The whole XXXX system is rigged against you. The only thing that should matter is your payments being made on time. 
And why does it take months and years to build credit ... .and five seconds to destroy it ... .and why has my score been going down as I have been acquiring more credit. The XXXX tell you that getting new credit raises your score ... ..they lie. And they are able to judge your score without even knowing your debt to income ratio ... I mean if whats more important ... .your use of credit level % ... ..or your ability to pay it off???? 
What in the XXXX does credit shopping have to do with a credit score????? I????????? 
If you don't take on new debt, or too much debt ... .maybe there is nothing wrong. 
We should be rewarded for shopping around for credit ... .not punished. 
What is the XXXX does maxing out your line of credit on occasion have to do with being a credit risk???????????????????? 
How can you allow anyone to drop your score by 93 points for missing a payment you don't even know you are supposed to make. I caught it up immediately ... .but the damage is done. And now with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Coronavirus ... ..that SBA loan and my house refinance that would save us {$500.00} dollars a month on our house payment and lower our debt to equity ratio ... .my ability to survive on the back side of this disaster I had nothing to do with??? I will do to you what you did to me but with the idea that you do not stay in business. How many jobs would that be at XXXX XXXX  ... .you win one law suit ... and all the others come out of the woodworks ... .right?? Class action ... social media posting ... .an evening news cast ( TV ) portraying what you do to people??? / I will eventually testify before Congress and I will make sure I make the networks allow me to tell others about you. 
I also have a XXXX account at XXXX XXXX ... ..which I was lied to about. 
XXXX XXXX told me I was opening a builders account ... ..like I have at 4 other material suppliers. They never mentioned it was a credit card ... .lying XXXX 's. 
Even worse ... .XXXX  only allows autopay to be set up directly to your checking account. They will not take a credit card payment ... .meaning I don't get to collect and make points from my XXXX  payment through XXXX  XXXX XXXX  payments ... ..like the XXXX miles that flew my wife and kids to my wife 's home country of XXXX for XXXX XXXX .without points, impossible. For that reason ... XXXX XXXX looses about {$100000.00} in business from me a year. I have 5 other builder accounts. The only reason I shop at XXXX is either job site convenience ... .or the other suppliers don't carry what XXXX  does. 
So ... .never mind my perfect payment history ... perfect. Never mind I did not even know that I was supposed to pay this account. Never mind that XXXX  chooses to stay in the ice age and not set up auto pay through means other than bank draft. 
XXXX would not play nice ... .so we are going to ding him 93 points in one 30 day reporting period for being 30 days late?????????? 
Oh my XXXX ... the algorithms say his in distress, he is in trouble ... .he is going down ... .lets down grade him. Lets not find out what the XXXX is actually going on ... .lets not tell him that we were calling on a separate account he did not know he even had ... .both in XXXX XXXX  ... .lets just drop his score right when his XXXX taxes are fixing to be done and filed ... and he is going to refinance his house ... and he needs an SBA assistance loan to survive the Coronavirus .... XXXX you all and may it be done unto you as you do to others. You punish those who do right for the sins ( thats why you make the rules ... the sins of others ) of others.

How arrogant a system who relies on blind algorithm and rules instead of checking in to see what is going on. 
Its like relying on math to see if your kids are ok, rather than getting off your XXXX XXXX XXXX to just walk into the bedroom, kiss them good night ... and talk to them in person. 
Its like firing someone bases on what an algorithm says, rather than any basis or reason. Oh ... the math was not in favor for you today ... .you are fired ... .you are chosen to die. 
And since when does shopping for credit mean you are desperate??????? Lets see ... .oh ... they use of credit combined with shopping ... the math says thats dangerous and desperate ... .so lets punish him. 
Anyway ... ..93 points in a 30 day reporting period short of not making any payments and filing for bankruptcy ... .is stupid, arcane, arrogant ... and criminal. You are either with me or against me in this fight. 
I just won out all by myself against XXXX XXXX trying to bully me on XXXX XXXX, lying on what my bank statement showed ... .and I got a full refund. They thought they could win too.They transferred me to 8 different people in 6 different office locations over 8 months, each time making me start the complaint process over again and threatening to put it on my credit. 
I am at war with anyone who supports this evil system of destroying people and holding them back for no reason ... ..and you are either with me or against me. And I never ever lose. 
If you have any XXXX power or can actually do something ... .then please give me a call. Otherwise ... don't waste my time ... and pass me along to someone who can do something.

480,04/17/20,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Closing an account,Company closed your account,"I opened a 1 year XXXX ( 2.5 % interest rate ) with Citibank and received a letter from them dated XX/XX/2020 stating my XXXX  would mature on XX/XX/2020 and that it would automatically renew for the same term unless I request a change. So, to this effect, I called Citibank on XX/XX/2020 and spoke with XXXX ( reference number XXXX ). I told her I received the letter and wanted to make sure the XXXX does not renew. She at some point said she was having difficulty hearing me but then seemed like she understood the reason for my call. She explained that if I did not wish for the XXXX to renew they could mail me a check and specified the amount that would be mailed to me ( which I later learned was not even the 2.5 % interest amount which I had originally agreed to ). At the end of the phone conversation, she told me to allow 5-7 business days for me to receive the check at which point I actually clarified and said, "" you mean 5-7 days AFTER the maturity date '' to which she clearly replied "" yes ''. At no point did I say I wanted to terminate the XXXX prior to the maturity date. I was very clear as to the intent of my call which was simply to make sure that the XXXX did not automatically renew. 

On XX/XX/2020, I received a check in the mail ( in amount which was actually {$550.00} less that the amount XXXX had told me ) from Citibank. It was then that I realized what she had done. She had quoted me the value of my XXXX  on the day of my call ( before maturity ) and taken it upon herself to close the account prior to maturity rather than waiting for the XXXX to mature and then send the check which is what I understood she was going to do. I called Citibank that same evening and discussed the issue with the supervisor ( XXXX ) who told me she would file my complaint with XXXX and send her an email to see if XXXX or her manager could fix the problem since XXXX, the supervisor, was unable to do so. I inquired with XXXX and she confirmed that Citibank would be able to listen to the pre-recorded phone call to verify my complaint using the reference number above. She also recommended that I call at XXXX the next morning and file a "" Presidential complaint '' with the Executive Response Unit. I tried to do this the following morning but when I called Citibank and spoke with XXXX, the daytime supervisor, she said that office could not be contacted due to COVID-19 and that I would just have to wait for them to call me directly since XXXX had put in a request for them to contact me the prior evening ( which she had not told me she would do. XXXX assured me the Executive Response Unit would call me the same day since XXXX had put in the request but I received no such call. 

I called my local branch in XXXX, XXXX  on XX/XX/2020 and spoke with XXXX, the assistant manager, and was told the branch would be unable to assist me since the XXXX was closed by the customer service representative over the phone. I was told to call them back to try to resolve the problem. 

I have since called several more times ( with hold times over an hour and at times even being hung up on before being able to speak to any representative ) but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get the full amount which I am due for the 1 year XXXX  that I did not authorize to be closed prior to the termination date. In fact, I have not cashed the check yet from Citibank because theoretically the funds should have remained in the XXXX  until XX/XX/2020 and I fully intended to keep the funds there until maturity. I even suggested to Citibank to put a stop check in effect and "" reopen '' the XXXX since I did not authorize it to be closed but they told me that would not be possible.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report.

505,04/01/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"To whom it may concern, I am contacting today because I am trying to make a payment on my mortgage with Wells Fargo. It has been nothing but near impossible to make any sort of payment. I have been avidly trying for 3 days now for hours to get through to somebody to make a payment to. 

I have tried calling in to make a payment, but hold times are easily over an hour. I have called multiple times now and each call has been over an hour long and I get through to nobody. 

They have revoked automated payment system because it is delinquent. So I am unable to call and use the automated payment system to make a payment. 

They have revoked online payment so I can not pay my mortgage online either. 

I have went to a branch, but they only will take cash or a check. I have been doing a transfer payment for 5 years now, and now they will not take it. I am unable to draw the {$1500.00} I was go pay from an ATM for obvious reasons. 

I, and many others, have been waiting endlessly on hold and getting nowhere. I have reached out to a branch, their twitter account that supposed to be for 24/7 customer support is not responding, the bank refuses to do a transfer. 

The options they have given me and all others is must pay cash or check, fill out a form to have them call you which will do no good because I will be in contact with a loan officer, they say to pay online or over the phone but you can't do that because of wait times and them locking people out of paying that way. 

Wells Fargo should not even be allowed to be in business. They say how they are working so hard to help customers out, but as far as I remember it they have been in front of Congress 3 times in 10 years for how they "" help '' people. Like when they made all those bank accounts illegally in other peoples names, or helping cause the market crash in 2008, or even here in Colorado holding paperwork until it's late to hold the interest rate ransom. 

I am just trying to pay my mortgage and Wells Fargo is doing nothing to help, but everything they can to make it impossible to pay the bill. I personally think they want this to go over so they can just begin foreclosing and taking all the housing away from the people who actually keep the business going between bailouts they manage to get.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CO,None,None,Consent provided,Web,04/01/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3589342,may concern contact today try make payment mortgage well fargo nothing near impossible make sort payment avidly try 3 days hours get somebody make payment try call make payment hold time easily hour call multiple time call hour long get nobody revoke automate payment system delinquent unable call use automate payment system make payment revoke online payment pay mortgage online either go branch take cash check transfer payment 5 years take unable draw 150000 go pay atm obvious reason many others wait endlessly hold get nowhere reach branch twitter account suppose 24 7 customer support respond bank refuse transfer options give others must pay cash check fill form call good contact loan officer say pay online phone cant wait time lock people pay way well fargo even allow business say work hard help customers far remember front congress 3 time 10 years help people like make bank account illegally people name help cause market crash 2008 even colorado hold paperwork late hold interest rate ransom try pay mortgage well fargo nothing help everything make impossible pay bill personally think want go begin foreclose take house away people actually keep business go bailouts manage get,0,0,1

We turned to the community and all other clients of Truist are experiencing the same problem, some holding for up to 5 hours in a call without ever getting an answer.

The few cases we know that got through after many hours, are extremely disappointed, since all Truist offers is a 90 days forbearance, in other words, people who chooses this option will not pay anything for 3 months, but will have to produce the mortgage payment of all 4 months on the fourth month or will face foreclosure.

I also have reason to believe there was not an authorized or legitimate VA home inspector that was used for the home and the document used was also falsified by the realtor and the mortgage broker. 

In late XX/XX/XXXX I discovered massive structural damage to all the exterior walls and the master bathroom. These serious issues wouldve been caught with the house if a legitimate home inspection report had been used. 

By the end of XX/XX/XXXX my home was declared by a local engineer as structurally dangerous. The XXXX County building department very soon after receiving the XXXX report, declared the home condemned until further notice and ordered me to leave the premises within 24 hours.

526,04/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Problem with a purchase or transfer,Card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase or transfer,"I engaged an auto mechanic XX/XX/XXXX I had known for approximately twenty-five years to rebuild the engine in my XXXX XXXX. The mechanic sent the engine to a machine shop and after a year, the car came back with parts left out of the engine. The mechanic reluctantly installed the parts, and informed me he was going out of business. He returned the car to me at the end of XXXX when he was closing his doors. The car overheats and will not run for more than about 15 miles on the freeway without losing all coolant, with the overflow bottle blowing out and steam everywhere. There is also an engine knock and low oil pressure. When I complained to the mechanic in an email ( attached ), he referred me to the machine shop ( attached ), with whom I had no contract. The machine shop blamed the problems on the mechanic ( attached ). As three of the four sums I paid to the mechanic were through my Wells Fargo Visa debit card ( {$7000.00} XX/XX/XXXX, {$5900.00} XX/XX/XXXX and {$870.00} XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a merchant dispute. A provisional credit was initially given, but taken back in XXXX. I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying the matter was closed and the dispute denied. Despite that the Wells Fargo documentation correctly describes the dispute as 13.3 Defective/not as described ( XXXX pgs. 7-9 attached ), page two of the XX/XX/XXXX letter I received from XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo ( attached ) describes the situation more as a 10.3 ( i.e. no unauthorized transaction ). I never claimed someone else used my card. Rather I complained the merchant did not perform the work adequately. Moreover, the merchant did not provide documentation proving my car runs properly, In fact, his later of XX/XX/XXXX admits there were problems. The merchant also admits he was "" liquidating his business '' ( which is why I could not go back to him for correction of the problems ). When I asked him in an email ( attached ) for relief he referred me to the machine shop, a third party with whom I have no contract and who refuses to take any responsibility. I paid the mechanic, not the machine shop, who the mechanic selected. 

Visa and Wells Fargo seem to have sided with the merchant when no compelling evidence and no third party documentation such as a second opinion letter have been provided by the merchant. I provided a second opinion letter ( attached ) at the direction of Wells Fargo, and this seems to have been ignored. Also, it seems Wells Fargo and perhaps Visa ( no access to Visa is provided by the bank ) changed the dispute from defective merchandise to fraud based on page 2 of the XX/XX/XXXX letter from Wells Fargo "" Based on additional documents from the merchant, it was determined the charges were made by the customer or an authorized person.

531,04/23/20,Debt collection,Medical debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"in XX/XX/2020, I was contacted by PFC, Professional Finance Company about a bill for a medical service. I went through the process to pay the debt, however, when they continually asked for my private information ( last 4 of social, address, etc ), I turned them down to process the payment because it seemed as though there was a possibility it was fraudulent. The representative told me that in order to process the payment, she needed my identity information. I told her no. 
I went and paid the original entity the amount due. 
PFC processed my payment on my credit card anyhow, without my final authorization. So now I have paid this debt twice. When I contacted them to tell them that they processed payment without authorization, they told me that they could send me a check in 1-2 weeks and could not electronically reverse the payment. After many  complaints, and them listening to the recording, they overnighted me a check for the payment. During all of this they were very aware of the fact that I had already made the payment to the original entity. I have offered to them several times the authorization code and transaction number of the payment made directly to the original entity.

Today, 3 months later, I get another call that I still owe this money. When I explained to the rep that it was paid, and offered the payment information again, she proceeded to tell me that I had to email them the payment proof from my bank. My online banking will not go back that far. I have the printed authorization showing it was paid, yet the rep yelled at me and then hung up telling me it was "" still in collections ''. The fact that they hung up on me when I was explaining my position is infuriating.

548,04/07/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"On XX/XX/2018, I opened a CareCredit/Synchrony Bank ( CC/S ) Account through my XXXX  office for XXXX  for {$5600.00}. On the sales draft between me and CC/S, the XXXX   office coded the purchase correctly for no interest for 12 months. That day, a few minutes later, the XXXX  called the company back and had them change the purchase to No Interest If Paid In Full for a term of 36 months. The representative of CC/S advised both of us, on speaker phone, on the 1st statement, it should change to the correct term of 36  months. 

From XXXX to XX/XX/2018, the promotion was correct ; No Interest If Paid In Full. On XXXX 's statement, the promotion was changed to Fixed Payment Reduced APR. Myself and the XXXX   called continuously to CC/S to get the promotion changed back. On XXXX 's statement, the interest charges were refunded onto the account. Then on XXXX 's statement, the promotion was changed back to Fixed Payment Reduced APR. When calling CC/S, they advised someone had called and told them the cardholder ( me ) asked for it to be changed to a Fixed Payment Reduced APR promotion. When asked for the confirmation for that phone call, they are unable to produce my call, as I did not make one asking for the change. I did not accept the Fixed Payment Reduced APR promotion by writing, orally, or through any type of expressed consent. 

From XX/XX/XXXX to present day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the promotion has been Fixed Payment Reduced APR and I have been being charged interest each month. 

Within this time period, myself and the XXXX  have called CC/S over an unknown amount of times. Myself and the XXXX  have called separately and together in the same room to CC/S, as they tell us both that we both need to call to have it changed. When the XXXX  calls, they tell the XXXX I need to call. When I call, they tell me the XXXX needs to call to have it changed. When we are on the call together, they tell us they can not change it anymore as it is past the 90 days. 

I have talked with multiple representatives, mangers, and supervisors. Each one tells me they are unable to change it back as it has been over the 90 day period, though we have both been calling since the month it was noticed it was not changed. 

I have had two supervisors over the last few months tell me they can change it, as I have told them ( as I have in the past ) that I have the original sales draft with the correct promotion. The first supervisor told me they would request the change and it would take 2 statements to change and all of the interest, well over {$1000.00}, would be refunded to the account. He advised to send in the sales draft using their online message and he would personally get it fixed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in the sales draft. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message advising it had not been changed due to not having a 36  month promotion and to respond to have it changed to a 6,12, or 24 month. On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded back asking questions about how the 24  month would be implemented. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message saying they corrected the purchase to 24  month deferred interest and within 24/48 hours, the interest should be refunded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the account for the change. It hadn't been changed and therefore, I sent a message using the same chat feed to ask about the interest charges still showing. On XX/XX/XXXX, they responded advising they needed more time to complete research and would send a written response and it could take up to 30 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message asking for another update on the interest charges and advising the sales draft, which was the legal binding contract needed to send to have it changed, was sent. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message stating the information was incorrect and this individual would forward the inquiry to the Promotions team to code to a 24  month promotion and it could take two billing cycles. A written response would be sent with the resolution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the written statement advising the promotion would not be changed and advised to refer to the store/provider where the item was purchased to have the promotion corrected. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the company about the "" resolution '' and the supervisor advised she requested for the change to happen to 36  months and to look for the interest to be refunded on the next/XXXX  statement and a written letter again. 

As of this date, XX/XX/XXXX, the interest has not been refunded. The account has been paid on time and in full each month.

570,04/08/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"Disputed XXXX Payment XX/XX/XXXX I requested to send {$150.00} to receiver through my BMO Harris mobile app that didn't go through but was place on hold. 
I received an email immediately after from BMO Harris and within the email, attached, I was advised to call immediately to verify my identity so that my funds could be released. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes a representative came on the line & advised that the department that is able to release the hold on my XXXX payment wasn't in. I advised the rep that I wanted a supervisor/manager to call me about the email I received advising me to call immediately only to find out the department was not in. No one called. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was at work and late morning I received an email, attached, advising that my funds had been released to receiver. I never spoke to the department that was suppose to verify my identity and within the email I had received from BMO Harris on XX/XX/XXXX, attached, it stated that my payment would not be released and would be cancelled if I didn't speak to the department that was not in on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called BMO Harris and was told that nothing could be done. I asked for a supervisor/manager to call me & advised the rep at BMO that I was at work till XXXX XXXX  that day but on XX/XX/XXXX I was off and could accept a call at any time. At XXXX XXXX  I received a call, but couldn't answer as I was at work, and the rep from BMO Harris XXXX left a message stating that she would call me in the morning on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Around XXXX XXXX  I still had not received a call from BMO Harris rep XXXX and called BMO Harris. I spoke with a rep named XXXX who advised that he was messaging XXXX and she would give me a call but she never did. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called BMO Harris around XXXX XXXX  and spoke to a supervisor/manager XXXX who told me that once a XXXX payment had been initiated it could not be cancelled. XXXX was the first rep that ever mentioned this. I asked XXXX then if it could not be cancelled how could I get an email saying if I didn't call to verify my identity that my payment would be cancelled? XXXX said she'd look into everything and call me back on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to XXXX that I worked XXXX and would not be able to answer the phone during those hours so I needed her to call me before XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from BMO Harris never called before XXXX XXXX. Instead she called around XXXX XXXX  and was shocked that I answered the phone. 
XXXX advised that there wasn't anything that could be done. I told XXXX I wanted someone above her to call me on XX/XX/XXXX as this was my day off and could take the call any time that day. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a call around XXXX XXXX from a rep XXXX who said that he was advised to call me before XXXX. I asked XXXX how he got that information because I had said that I could accept a call any time that day. There is no communication within BMO Harris ; not with there customers and not within their organization. XXXX told me that the first rep that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX could not give me all the information about my account because it had to do with the XXXX portion of my account and that department was not in that day. I asked XXXX how it could possibly be that a representative from BMO Harris is not able to give their customers all the necessary information pertaining to their account ; their money, in order for BMO Harris 's customers to be able to make sound decisions about their money that they work for? So basically BMO Harris doesn't think it's necessery to give their customers all the pertinant information about their account so that they can make sound decisions about their finances. I told XXXX I wanted someone above him to call me about this because this does not seem right. 
XXXX told me that someone would give me a call by week 's end, XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I hadn't heard from anyone from BMO Harris and decided to go into the XXXX, IL location. I worked with a banker, XXXX, who said she was going to file an internal complaint about what was happening with the lack of communication about my situation and played the message I had save from XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX stating she'd call me the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX No one from BMO Harris had called so I reached back out to XXXX by phone and she said no one had responded to her about the internal complaint but she would follow-up. 

XX/XX/XXXX No one from BMO Harris has called. I called XXXX at the XXXX, IL BMO Harris location and she told me there was no response. What is going on? No one from BMO Harris cares that their customer is out {$150.00} of their hard earned money. XXXX asked if I would like to have her manager, XXXX, give me a call. I said yes and setup a time for XXXX to call me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from BMO Harris calls at XXXX to hear my horror story. XXXX advises that she's going to look into everything and will get back to me the following week XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls and leaves a message advising that she knows I'm at work and can not answer but she just wanted to follow-up and would not be in on my day off, XX/XX/XXXX but would reach out to me on XX/XX/XXXX The reason I'm filing my claim is because I have no faith in XXXX resolving my situation and getting me my hard earned {$150.00} that was not suppose to be sent. The lack of communication that BMO Harris has with their customers and within their organization is astounding. BMO Harris doesn't care what they tell their customers and that they don't think it's important to give their customers all the important information about their account in order for their customers to make sound decisions about their hard earned money. 

Disputed unauthorized charges made on my BMO Harris Debit Card XX/XX/XXXX I looked at my BMO Harris mobile app and noticed there was a pending charge from XXXX XXXX. I had never heard of this place, let alone done any business with them. Knowing that BMO Harris Bank can not do anything with pending charges I called XXXX XXXX to find out why there was a pending charge on my debit card. XXXX XXXX had all my information but the email they had on file did not match the only email that I have used since the XXXX 's XXXX. XXXX XXXX reversed the charge and credited me back the money. Because of this pending charge on my account and it had just been the XXXX  season I took a look back through my banking transactions and noticed that there were several charges that were not made by me and being that I don't give my debit card out to anyone I called BMO Harris to dispute the transactions that I did not make, which I have attached the denial letters from BMO Harris. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received emails containing PDFs, attached, denying my claims. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called into BMO Harris to dispute my denial letters pertaining to my disputed charges. Spoke with a rep who advised me to send an email & advised me of what to write within the email, attached, while I was on the phone with the rep. 

XX/XX/XXXX I had not heard anything from BMO Harris pertaining to my disputed charges. I went into the BMO Harris branch in XXXX, IL & worked with a banker named XXXX. I wrote a statement disputing my charges again because it didn't appear to XXXX that my email I sent on XX/XX/XXXX had been received. XXXX faxed my denial letter. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called the BMO Harris XXXX, IL branch and spoke with XXXX inquiring about when I was going to hear about my disputing the denial letter that I faxed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX advised that my claim was again denied but that BMO Harris does NOT have to reach out to the customer. So basically the customer has no idea what is going on with their claim. BMO Harris 's customers are just suppose to sit in limbo wondering what is going on with their claim. How could this be? A BMO Harris customer reaches out for help and BMO Harris doesn't bother to respond on the status. And not only that they flat out tell you that they are not going to let their customers know what is going on and that is somehow just suppose to be ok. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called BMO Harris in XXXX, IL to find out what else I can do in order to get my disputed charges claim reviewed again. I have proof that on the dates of the disputed charges that I was at work, and as we all know no one can be in two places at once. XXXX asks if I would like to speak with her manager, XXXX, and a call is scheduled with XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from BMO Harris calls at XXXX to hear my horror story. XXXX advises that she's going to look into everything and will get back to me the following week XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls and leaves a message advising that she knows I'm at work and can not answer but she just wanted to follow-up and would not be in on my day off, XX/XX/XXXX but would reach out to me on XX/XX/XXXX The reason I'm filing my claim is because I have no faith in XXXX resolving my situation and getting me my hard earned {$160.00} & {$16.00} that was charged to my debit card by someone else and not me. {$53.00} of my disputed charges was for an online retailer XXXX XXXX & I was given a provisional credit that was then reversed.

I contacted them to inquire about the debt and was informed that the charges are somehow related to an apartment rented by my ex-boyfriend, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

During my conversation with the agent, which would certainly be considered a "" communication '' as defined under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 USC 1692a, I was not given the mini-Miranda as required by the Act. I explained to the agent that I temporarily resided at this apartment with my then boyfriend, but that I had no contractual obligation under the lease. However, the agent refused to accept my dispute for investigation. I then requested validation of the debt ; asking that they provide me with an itemization of the balance being charged and some sort of documentation showing my own contractual liability, such as my signature on the lease. The agent refused to honor my request, told me to call back when I was "" ready to pay '' and hung up on me. I've sent a written request for this same validation yet they have continuously refused to provide it, in violation of 15 USC 1692g 809. 

Further, their refusal to adequately investigate my dispute, while continuing to adversely report it to the credit reporting agencies, is a blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 USC 1681 and its subsequent amendment, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ( FACTA ). Under these Acts, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information and the data furnisher has an obligation to investigate that dispute. Inaccurate or unverifiable information must be corrected or deleted by the furnisher. IQ Data International continues to refuse me these rights as required by law. 

This is not my debt. This apartment was rented strictly in the name of my ex-boyfriend, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I never signed any lease for this apartment and have no contractual obligation for this debt if it is even legitimately owed ; which still has yet to be determined. 

My attempts to correct IQ Data 's records and restore my credit with regard to this item have been in vain. Research on this collection agency shows that they are not an active member of XXXX XXXX, nor an accredited business with the XXXX, and that their standard XXXX  complaint responses are both dismissive and uncooperative ... so I guess my failed attempts are not surprising. I have also attempted to remedy the situation by filing indirect disputes directly with the credit reporting agencies, themselves. However, IQ Data continues to verify the information as accurately reported without conducting a proper investigation.

589,04/21/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"I am writing because I have recently been involved with Citibank customer service, trying to clear up some problems with Overdraft and NSF fees incurred over the past month or so in my checking account ( XXXX ). From XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXXthe account incurred {$270.00} in fees, some of which have since been reversed. The account is currently overdrawn by - {$86.00} and two more fees are about to be assessed for transactions on the XXXX and the XXXX of XXXX. The problem is that the overdrawn amount is all in fees. In fact, looking at the history of the account, the fees are simply creating more and more fees. 

As of three days ago, for example, my account should have been back in the black. I talked via Online Chat to an agent about two fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and one fee on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX a total of {$100.00} ). At the end of the chat, the agent told me ( I quote precisely from the conversation ), I have reversed the fees for you and it will be credited to your account in 24-48 hours. That did not happen. Had it happened, the two recent transactions of XX/XX/XXXX and 21, the ones about to generate NSF fees, would have been covered. Yesterday, when I discovered that the three charges my online Chat agent said would be reversed were not reversed, I started another online Chat but was directed to call Customer Service. After waiting for 1 1/2 hours on hold, I was finally connected to a Supervisor. I tried to explain to her the circumstances of my Chat, hoping to correct the fact that the fees were not yet reversed. I also pointed out that it was getting to be a situation I could not handle because of the loss of work due to the Coronavirus shutdown and my thinly stretched resources. I also let her know that I thought my situation was unfair because it seemed that fees were just creating more fees. We got into just one example, a {$34.00} overdraft fee assessed on XX/XX/XXXX, a fee caused by the Monthly Service Fee of {$12.00}. This is a fee that the bank offered to and did waive as part of their effort to be mindful of and helpful with customers at this time when many of us are facing economic hardship. Before I could even get into the total situation or figure out why the fees I was told were going to be reversed were not, the Supervisor said, No, no, we dont have to waive that fee for you even though it was caused by the fee that the bank is waiving. Her tone was appallingly rude, so I asked her for her name, which she said so quickly that I couldnt understand it. Then, just as quickly, she hung up on me. This made me a little suspicious. Why wouldnt she explain why my fees werent reversed as described? And, are banks legally allowed to generate fee charges from fee charges that are later reversed? 

I looked again through my ledger and noted a few things. The first Overdraft Fee in this chain was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00}. The bank reversed these fees on XX/XX/XXXX. This caused the account to become overdrawn by {$33.00}. If that money had been in the account, the next two NSF fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX payment of {$60.00} would not have been assessed because there would have been enough to cover the payment. ( These fees were paid when I deposited {$290.00} in the account on XX/XX/XXXX ). The next set of fees ( {$34.00} each ) comes on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX for another XXXX XXXX XXXX paymen of {$60.00}. I had made the deposit of {$290.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, trying to make sure this was all covered, but it ended up not being enough because the {$34.00} NSF fee was assessed retroactively to that day, so I couldnt have known about it when I made the deposit. Then the last Overdraft fee appears XX/XX/XXXX, a fee that was, as stated above, caused by the monthly service charge, which itself was waived. Finally, there are the two charges about to be assessed. 

I must say, I was really hoping to have all these charges reversed because charges that were deemed reversible caused other charges to occur. In real time, I was trying to keep up with these charges by refuting them and having them reversed and even by depositing enough money to cover them. The situation of fees causing other fees has had a domino effect on the account that I simply will not be able to recover from at this time while we are all under lock-down. I still do not know why the charges that were going to be reversed were not. But all this has certainly worked to the banks advantage.

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information
( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : XXXX  XXXX | XX/XX/2019 I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

612,04/14/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Policy states ...

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public

621,04/02/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

It has also been discovered that these STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me. 

STUDENT LOAN CREDITORS : XXXX/DOFED ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX Policy states ... 

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

629,04/04/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"To Whom it Should Concern, We received the second investigative response that no corrections would be made for our escalation. We understand that regulation allows you to commit to a rate lock but allows terms that you can later change. However, as far as customer service we do not feel this was fully investigated. There were a number of things that were mishandled in our mortgage process. I have provided a timeline and copies of emails to support. Its concerning to be notified that NOTHING was found to be incorrect from a customer service perspective and feel very strongly we were given a loan under false pretenses. Additionally, from the time that this began XXXX, XXXX boss informed us that the Executive team would not change anything. This process has proven that to be very true. 
We have not had anything further explained, the internal investigation explained, or even a new agent changed despite a request by phone to the escalations team, the 800 general number, or reaching out to our local branch. Our trust and confidence with Wells Fargo at this point is non-existent. Because of the lack of communication and resolution, well be sharing this with the VA and XXXX XXXX XXXX as well since this is the second internal investigation with the same conclusion. Were being asked to submit a third. We have little faith that this will be fairly investigated and resolved. 

Timeline of Poor Customer Experience from Wells Fargo ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX Received confirmation of 3.25 % interest rate from XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX we received the emails to start the application process with WF and an email from XXXX with the preapproval letter. We submit the requested information. 
XXXX XXXX requests additional information. We provide within 24 hours. 
XXXX The pre-approval letter received does not contain the discussed interest amount and requires a down payment. XXXX follows up after a phone discussion to get the updated letter. XXXX confirms he is working on it. 
XXXX XXXX responds back to the same email stating that hes still working on the pre-approval letter but rates are different than what he first stated. 
XXXX Receive first email from XXXX XXXX requesting additional documentation for closing. The same day we answer questions and start requesting documents. 
XXXX Requested Tax Forms are sent via secure email. 
XXXX Additional documents are requested. The offer letter is requested for XXXX XXXX, the company relocating is XXXX XXXX and provided via email. W9s are signed and returned. This is also the first request for rental statements, XXXX sends an XXXX file downloaded from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 12 months. 
XXXX XXXX informs us that the XXXX sheet for rental payments is not sufficient. Outlines what she believes the underwriter will need. XXXX reaches out to XXXX XXXX to request statements for 12 months as they are not available online that far back. 
XXXX We receive an application update to sign the Intent to Proceed. We let XXXX know that XXXX has not yet updated the pre-approval with the correct interest rate for us to proceed. 
XXXX On XXXX, since we still do not have the 3.25 % locked we provide XXXX with a pre-approval letter from another lender who is also approved for direct bill for relocation closing costs. 
XXXX XXXX follows up to see where XXXX is with the updated rate. 
XXXX XXXX replies that the 3.25 % is confirmed. XXXX states that a new pre-approval can not be generated and provides us with a rate lock document. 
XXXX Janeine emails XXXX and XXXX to ask if the rate lock period will be extended from XX/XX/XXXX since the rate is new and just sent on XXXX. XXXX states that they lowered the rate and it can not be changed, we would have to pay to extend. We inform the other bank that we will be proceeding with Wells Fargo. The clock is now ticking. 
XXXX XXXX provides 12 months of XXXX statements and check numbers for payments made from checking account for requested rent verification via secure email. 
XXXX Email sent from XXXX XXXX introducing herself as our loan processor and requesting additional information. 
XXXX Information is returned within 24 hours. XXXX informs us that we now need 24 months of rent proof. 
XXXX XXXX  offers to reach out to the landlord to get a letter stating payments on time. XXXX suggests waiting to see if the underwriter accepts 12 months. 
XXXX Documents requested through secure mail. Send XXXX an email outlining what we previously discussed that documents were loaded on XXXX. He states he will follow up with XXXX ( shes not copied ). 
XXXX XXXX provides updates on the requested information ( His comments in parenthesis ). States he will follow up with a call once he has the forms we were not provided. Please note which requested items he stated are NOT needed. 
XXXX XXXX sends follow up email to XXXX as we have not heard back on the previous email or received required forms. 
XXXX We receive conditional approvals with another list of requested documents. It finally includes the VA Questionnaire and Amendatory Clause. As well as numerous requests for information we already submitted, clarified or were told we no longer needed. 
XXXX XXXX responds to the errors with the following note. XXXX replies that she will hold on further documentation requests until she hears back from XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX responds via secure mail to the initial request asking for landlord information instead. XXXX sends it to her. 
XXXX XXXX sends an email through XXXX to update the to do list. Again we are told to disregard some of the requests. We return the VA and Amendatory forms the same day they are sent to us. 
XXXX We request a breakdown of closing costs and return the documents for HOA costs via XXXX  email. 
XXXX XXXX sends an amended list of items still remaining, inclusive of the rate lock and closing dates. Half of them we were given different updates and direction from XXXX on. Specificially : Number 3 we were told to disregard. XXXX is relocating.

Number 5, we already explained and XXXX was following up with the underwriter. These would be done AFTER the sale of the house.

Number 12, we provided the name and email address of our landlord to XXXX at this point. 
XXXX XXXX responds through secured mail following me calling her to understand the repeat requests. I reply back with answers. She then asks for XXXX most recent paystub. 
XXXX XXXX informs XXXX that she can not confirm my employment with XXXX XXXX. I had just started on XXXX so the 3rd party did not have my information. I provided her information for the HR team that I worked with and it was verified via phone the same day. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX document sent as requested via secure mail. 
XXXX XXXX Paystub sent as requested via secure email. 
XXXX Request for XXXX to be resent the link for secured email as he does not have access. XXXX responds that he will have XXXX send. Sends via XXXX. 
XXXX We received the direct bill closing cost estimate requested on XXXX. 
XXXX Receive another loan tracker update of missing documents. Email via XXXX to request information be updated as documents were already submitted via secure mail. Receive a response back from XXXX that he will get them cleared out. 
XXXX Receive another update via secured email from XXXX requesting already submitted or incorrect information. Receive a response back from XXXX that he will follow up directly with XXXX. XXXX then requests to speak with us regarding the items requested by XXXX. XXXX speaks with him and he apologizes on XXXX behalf stating this is the first time theyve worked together. 
XXXX Upload remaining requested items based on phone conversation with XXXX with the exception of XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX Send requested XXXX XXXX information via secured email. 
XXXX Follow up via email with XXXX to confirm she got all the documents already submitted. She responds with items that WELLS FARGO needs to complete. She states that she still needs verification from the landlord and the Amendatory Clause back from the sellers agent. She reaches out for the first time on XX/XX/XXXX and the sellers closing agent returns it the same day. She confirms she has not yet reached out to the landlord despite being provided information on XXXX. This is now 20 days later. 
XXXX XXXX is now also requesting a letter from Harrys employer stating hes allowed to work from home and his pay will not be changing, though his role is not changing at all. 
XXXX Despite follow up, no additional responses or updates from Wells Fargo. 
XXXX Receive email around XXXX XXXX EST from XXXX letting us know that we need to return final documents by end of day to close on time. Send email to XXXX and inform her that he lives in XXXX which is why we provided email. Send a follow up email to XXXX asking him to respond as quickly as he can, despite it being XXXX XXXX. XXXX confirmed. 
XXXX Receive an email from XXXX stating he will follow back up with the underwriter. Respond at XXXX to XXXX clarifying XXXX work situation again. Receive request for a letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX   manager instead. 
XXXX Receive the following email at XXXX EST stating that if we dont provide the information we will need to push back closing on XX/XX/XXXX. Not a lot of time to provide new information like a number from a landlord in XXXX or a letter from an employer on a Friday afternoon. 
XXXX Extremely concerned we reached out to XXXX and XXXX by phone and neither answered. We send the following email : XXXX I would like to request that further follow ups take place over the phone and followed up with emails in the essence of time. Either of us can be available by cell phone. 
We have submitted information promptly and repeatedly since the start of this process. It would be extremely disappointing if we have to push back our close date due to delays we did not cause. 
We provided my landlord 's email address weeks ago so not sure why we are just reaching out this week. Our landlord ( he ) is in XXXX, so not certain he will respond today. I will go online and download as many statements as I can in the interim and upload them to the tracker. If we need to request from XXXX XXXX the turnaround will be 48 hours at least. 
For the work location- again it is not changing from the XXXX XXXX NJ address. XXXX is reaching out to his boss to see if a letter can quickly be drafted to reiterate what we have explained via email and phone. 
I would not have guessed that with healthy credit scores and incomes that could singularly support the mortgage we were approved for, this would be such an undertaking. We have a lot of other things ( temp housing, move dates ) hinged on this closing date. 
XXXX could you please follow up with XXXX as soon as you're available? 
XXXX Around XXXX I sent copies of rent checks manually pulled from the online site to XXXX XXXX They were sent via email for XXXX and XXXX because the loan tracker was completed and there was no where to upload. He responded back requesting a call. 
XXXX During our call, XXXX personally apologized for the email from XXXX and stated that hed spoken to her and advised that she should not have sent a note threating to push the closing date back. He then followed up with an email at XXXX just before close of business. A very stressful day for the both of us while at work. 
XXXX XXXX  promptly responds to our email stating hes traveling but will respond on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. We advise that theres no need. 
XXXX XXXX responds to an email we sent on XX/XX/XXXX asking about a new to-do item on the loantracker. We are informed we need to sign the VA form for XXXX. 
NOTE : This form was sent to him on XXXX by XXXX. This is also the date that Wells Fargo was notified of the regulation changes from the VA. 
XXXX We receive an email from XXXX confirming we have closed. 
XXXX Notified at XXXX by XXXX XXXX that the Survey fee direct billed could not be covered by the company and the closing cost we were sent had increased by XXXX. This is the first time we were notified. Respond at XXXX with company approval to cover the cost. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reaches out to XXXX via phone to inform him 3 days before closing that the loan can only be financed 95 %. This leaves ONE business day before closing on Monday the XXXX. An ENTIRE WEEK after the new loan rates were released by the VA. 2 days after Wells Fargo made the LTV adjustment. 1 day after on loan was approved. Had we been notified in a TIMELY manner, we could have had our previous bank process the loan. 

Escalations Process with Wells Fargo : XXXX An escalation started with speaking to XXXX boss XXXX XXXX He stated that he would escalate to the Executive Board of Complaints but "" he wouldn't expect a positive result from their review '' which was disheartening to both of us. These again, are words from YOUR representatives.

An escalations resolution specialist followed up, XXXX XXXX, stating that it would take a few weeks to review and follow up. Not in time for our closing. During the call with XXXX, he was again treated as though we were at fault for this egregious error and lack of accurate information provided to me. I was told that my complaint and concern was simply another case that needed to be reviewed and that there was nothing that could be done to help me before my approaching closing date. 

We were sent a survey during this, which XXXX completed and received notification that the case was being re-reviewed. 

XXXX We received a letter from XXXX stating the resolution. There were a number of misstated or misinformed assertions made : 1. You chose to lock your rate at 3.375 % on XX/XX/XXXX. False. Once presented, we asked for an update sheet with the correct percentage. 
XXXX. The lock rate was communicated as of XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX. Further, documents show us following up for the correct interest rate to be communicated on XX/XX/XXXX and documents being incorrect until XXXX when he came back with the correct interest rate because we produced an approval letter from another lender who could honor what he initially promised.

3. The letter states we were provided a request for additional information on XX/XX/XXXX. As the email trail shows, we provided all original documentation within 24 of asks. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent an email stating he was getting with the loan processor to understand was TRULY needed as she was asking for documents that we had already provided or not relevant to our situation ( example : relocation information for XXXX who was NOT the person using relocation benefits. Janeines company was providing ).

4. We understand that the processes take time and require additional information but even XXXX, YOUR representative spoke about the processors errors and incompetence and had to follow up multiple times to clarify, review our situation and what still needs to be collected. This is NOT what we expect from a company as large and established as Wells Fargo. This is our frustration with the documentation process- Proactive, timely documents were completed on our side only to be met with requests for new information, the same information again, or information not relevant to our loan. If you dont find any issue with that in your review thats even more unfortunate than this lack of investigation. This was the case until XXXX the Friday before closing. Please see the timeline for proof.

5. We have determined the account was handled properly and no corrections are needed as no error has occurred. And this is why we will be sharing with the VA and XXXX XXXX XXXX. More alarming than your lack of true escalation and investigation is the fact that per your document, XXXX and XXXX follow the process exactly as your company directs. If that is the case we want everyone to know what to expect when working with Wells Fargo on a mortgage. 
Early XXXX During a call to escalate our dissatisfaction with still being assigned to XXXX XXXX, XXXX was transferred from account services to XXXX XXXX. She stated that I could not request an advisor change I would need to reach out directly to XXXX manager. We left a voicemail for XXXX and received no response. When we reviewed Janeines additional concerns with their findings, she stated she did not think the lag in notification was an error on Wells Fargos part and would reinvestigate my assertion that even XXXX admitted errors were made. 

XXXX We receive a cover letter stating that after review, no additional investigation is deemed necessary. XXXX was called the same day by XXXX XXXX stating that she would reopen the case. As of XX/XX/XXXX, this has not occurred. 

The worst part of this situation isnt the painful process, the surprise ending, or the lack of care about customer service identified by leadership and the complaint board. The entire point of the VA loan was 100 % financing and expanded limits. This was promised to us from the start, finally put in writing with the threat of not using Wells Fargo, and then defended across the organization with not one solution proposed to ease the pain even after the loan closed. Were not only stuck with a loan that doesnt achieve what the VA set it up to do, but leaves us with the same advisor as the person who put us in the situation to begin with. 
Regardless of regulation, a delay in conveying the new parameters set by Wells Fargo ( not legislation ) robbed us of the opportunity to select a different lender without risk of losing a home we loved. This lack of honesty and deceptive business practice cost us the ability to select a lender and loan that truly met our needs. The Wells Fargo team who handled our loan was unprofessional and lacked knowledge throughout the process causing us distress as we were forced to resend countless documents due to being told inaccurate information or simply because the documents had been lost by our loan officer or his team. Due to Wells Fargo 's lack of honesty on their policy of fully financing VA Loans at 100 % I was given an inaccurate closing cost estimate provided by Loan Officer of {$36000.00}. 
As a veteran and second time customer of Wells Fargo I have never been so disappointed in my life in this entire experience. The lack of honesty and character shown by this group in response to this internal mistake is alarming and our fear that this treatment could be given to other veterans simply looking to purchase homes, as well who trust the Wells Fargo team to give them accurate information throughout the home buying process.

I've called and faxed both XXXX XXXX and barclay at least a dozen times over the last 4 weeks and no one has been able to remedy the situation. 

XXXX XXXX tells me that they've requested the payment be pulled back from barclaycard at least 4 times to issue me a refund, but they still have not received ANY type of response from barclaycard. 

I submitted 2 separate formal research requests to Barclaycard to find this payment and apply it correctly, and they still haven't found it / updated me after 3+ weeks. I've called barclaycard 1-2 times per week for status updates and their response has only been that they are still researching, and that they CAN NOT provide an estimated time to completion of the research request. 

As of now, I have no recourse or resolution for my {$4900.00} payment made to Barclaycard through XXXX XXXX and no one is able to help me. I just now got off the phone with Barclaycard again ( XX/XX/2020 at XXXX EST ) and they again have told me that there's no estimated time to completion / resolution of this request and that my almost {$5000.00} payment due on my card on XX/XX/XXXX1 is still due ( even though they are already in receipt of those funds since I've already paid ). 

I need help with reaching out to Barclaycard to track down this payment and apply it to my account. The general customer care line is unable to fix this, but I'm sure someone with knowledge of the XXXX XXXX bill pay receivables account can fix this within minutes. I have the exact time, date, and transaction number of my payment to Barclaycard from the XXXX XXXX payment receipt, so it's just a matter of searching the receivables account for that info and applying my payment.

I owe {$94.00} per month on an installment purchase. The {$94.00} was paid on time in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX payment was paid late. In XXXX I made a payment of {$110.00} which included a {$40.00} late fee for XXXX. The late fee is one of my problems. How can they charge a {$40.00} late fee on a {$94.00} amount owed? 

I was traveling XX/XX/XXXX so I paid the {$94.00} due in XXXX early in late XXXX before the bill was received. Then in XXXX I received a bill for {$130.00} with a late fee of {$43.00} for a total minimum payment due of {$180.00} How can I be charged a late fee again? How is the bill for {$130.00} when my agreed to payment is {$94.00} and the previous bill was paid in full? Especially when the XXXX payment was received in XXXX before the XXXX due date. I paid the {$180.00} by the due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I just received my bill due XX/XX/XXXX, for {$110.00}. When I called to dispute the charge, I was told that I had not paid all the fees. I asked what fees? I paid the last bill in full which included Amount Past Due. Why am I now being charged more than the installment fee originally agreed to? 

I was told there were other fees that I had not paid. I said how would I know there are other fees when the bill before this one included Amount Past Due and it was paid in full. 
They had no answer for that. I think they just add on fees whenever they want.

I called citi on XX/XX/20 and was told they would not be reversing the late fee ( caused by bank error ) nor would they be reversing the annual fee. The manager/ supervisor I spoke to made it seem like I was lying when I said a manager told me the annual fee would be reversed. If calls are recorded or noted Im sure it could be found that I was in fact told that. When I asked for a higher manager the representative told me they were only available during business hours ( although they answered my call meaning they are open? ),Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",AZ,851XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/21/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3616685,contact citi change credit card one annual fee manager speak tell annual fee would reverse refund make monthly payment owe unknown refund 10000 annual fee 10000 would cover balance leave leave credit make payment think would cover tell manager call citi 20 tell would reverse late fee cause bank error would reverse annual fee manager supervisor speak make seem like lie say manager tell annual fee would reverse call record note im sure could find fact tell ask higher manager representative tell available business hours although answer call mean open,0,0,0

665,04/17/20,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I terminated my lease early with a local apartment complex in XX/XX/2018. They accepted my surrender of the apartment, ( see attached email from XXXX XXXX ) triggering their duty to mitigate damages under applicable Georgia law. Accordingly they cant require me to repay the entire term of the lease when they have leased the property to someone else as of XX/XX/2018. ( See additional email communications confirming relent of apartment on XX/XX/2018 ). 

We were in the process of determining the final amount owed after they re-leased the property ; however, I never received a final account statement telling me what I owe. ( See email attachments ).

I then received a notice from IQ Data International attempting to collect XXXX on behalf of the apartment complex. I had never even been issued a final bill from the complex much less how I wound up in collections. When I asked for an explanation, the IQ Data representative XXXX spoke to me in a derogatory manner and told me I owed the full amount of accelerated rent. I told him lawfully this was not possible under Georgie law because ( 1 ) I never even received a final bill and ( 2 ) the complex accepted surrender of the property and relet it on XX/XX/2018. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA and they refused to send me copies of the final account statement they allegedly sent me in XX/XX/2018. Instead they sent me screen shots where they supposedly emailed me copies of the final statement. I requested they resend the original emails and the final account statement and received no response. 

IQ Data is increasing the amount I owe to over 7000 and when I spoke with them today their same employee XXXX said lady pay your bills already which was on a recorded line. 

He also told me that even though I was an attorney I didnt understand accelerated rent. 

Again-how you can be in collections over an amount you never received a bill for is beyond me and the failure to provide justification for that amount, continuing to impact my credit and speaking to me in a verbally abusive manner are unlawful.
